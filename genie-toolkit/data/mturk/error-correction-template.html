<h1>Correct the misunderstanding</h1>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>
We are building a virtual assistant that can help you control all your devices, social accounts, etc.
Our virtual assistant can do a lot of things now but it still has a hard time to understand the users,
and occasionally makes mistakes, especially when the sentence is ambiguous. So we would like you to help us
tell the assistant that they misunderstood you.
<p>
In the following, we show <em>the command you intended to give</em>,
and separately <em>what the assistant actually understood</em>. The two will be similar, but not quite the same.
  Your goal is to point out the mistake, and steer the assistant towards the correct command.
  In what you write, you should highlight the mistake only. <b>Do not repeat the command in full</b>, unless
  you really cannot think of another way to phrase the correction.

<p>Please keep in mind the following in completing your task:
</p><ul>
  <li>Be concise. Assume the assistant knows the context and remembers what it just understood.
  <li>Be as natural as possible. Imagine actually trying to perform the task and failing. Do you feel confused, at loss, angry, frustrated?
  <li><b>Do not limit yourself to coping the original command.</b>. Bridge the gap between the two commands instead.</li>
  <li><b>If you don't see the difference between the two commands, please type “no difference” exactly.</b>
  <li><b>If the two commands are not related at all, please type “unrelated” exactly.</b>
  <li>Some commands have one mistake, and <b>some have two</b>. When that happens, you must correct both mistakes at once.</li>
  <li><b>Keep quoted parts <span style="color:#FF0000;">(including the quote marks)</span>, emails, phone numbers identical</b>
  <li><b>Do not drop @ signs and # signs</b>
</ul>
<span style="color:#FF0000;">Warning: for the last two requirements, we have a script to verify and if you failed to meet them, the script will reject your answer.</span>

<h3>Examples</h3>
