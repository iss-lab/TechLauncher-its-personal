This is hands down the best tofu recipe I've ever had. I don't like the taste of tofu but this recipe makes it so  delicious. Make sure you line your baking sheet with aluminum foil tho because it's gonna be really hard to clean it up afterwards because the sauce that's not on the tofu pieces kinda burns.	this is hands down the best tofu recipe i 've ever had . i do n't like the taste of tofu but this recipe makes it so delicious . make sure you line your baking sheet with aluminum foil tho because it 's g onna be really hard to clean it up afterwards because the sauce that 's not on the tofu pieces kinda burns .	1
My tofu turned out the perfect texture and had a nice glazed coating with a subtle flavor. Maybe a tad too subtle for me so I might amp it up next time. But that's just a personal preference. (followed cook's notes and used brown sugar instead of agave due to what I had on hand.)	my tofu turned out the perfect texture and had a nice glazed coating with a subtle flavor . maybe a tad too subtle for me so i might amp it up next time . but that 's just a personal preference . -lrb- followe d cook 's notes and used brown sugar instead of agave due to what i had on hand . -rrb-	1
This is my go-to recipe for tofu, and my family eats a lot of tofu.  I like the texture and crust that forms with this method, and it is super easy to use in a stir fry dish, add protein to a salad, or just eat with steamed rice and vegetables.  It's very versatile and forgiving; I never measure anything, and improvise if I'm missing an ingredient.  I've made it exactly as written, though, and it is delicious.	this is my go-to recipe for tofu , and my family eats a lot of tofu . i like the texture and crust that forms with this method , and it is super easy to use in a stir fry dish , add protein to a salad , o r just eat with steamed rice and vegetables . it 's very versatile and forgiving ; i never measure anything , and improvise if i 'm missing an ingredient . i 've made it exactly as written , though , and it is delicious .	1
A big hit! I subbed 1 T brown sugar for the agave and omitted the ginger. Super delicious. Served with stir fry veggies and udon noodles.

When I first became vegetarian, I found this recipe for tofu, and it has been a constant in my recipe book ever since! It's super easy to make and has a great flavor. I actually let the tofu marinate in a small pan for a while before baking to give it an even stronger flavor. Sometimes I also broil the tofu for a short amount of time at the very end if I feel like having a crispier tofu.	when i first became vegetarian , i found this recipe for tofu , and it has been a constant in my recipe book ever since ! it 's super easy to make and has a great flavor . i actually let the tofu marinate in a small pan for a while before baking to give it an even stronger flavor . sometimes i also broil the tofu for a short amount of time at the very end if i feel like having a crispier tofu .	1
This is really really good. The sauce gets thick and sticky and just tastes good. I used tamari sauce for the soy so it would be gluten free but otherwise I didn't change a thing...you don't need to. Thank you Teri Rose for your recipe.	this is really really good . the sauce gets thick and sticky and just tastes good . i used tamari sauce for the soy so it would be gluten free but otherwise i did n't change a thing ... you do n't need to . thank you teri rose for your recipe .	1
I mades changes. In my version I used honey olive oil and I didn't add sesame seeds. I made this changes mainly because I didn't have the required ingredients. I also baked them on nonstick foil so they didn't come out crisp.

These were delicious! They were gobbled up within minutes at my potluck supper! I followed the recipe exactly minus the jalapeno I thought it had enough spice from the hot sriracha sauce alone. The tofu chunks stayed perfectly on the skewers. I used organic sprouted super-firm tofu which is usually more durable than a lot of the regular non-sprouted tofu blocks I've bought in grocery stores. (It has a more meaty less-smooth texture) If you use the right tofu it won't fall of the skewer.	these were delicious ! they were gobbled up within minutes at my potluck supper ! i followed the recipe exactly minus the jalapeno i thought it had enough spice from the hot sriracha sauce alone . the to fu chunks stayed perfectly on the skewers . i used organic sprouted super-firm tofu which is usually more durable than a lot of the regular non-sprouted tofu blocks i 've bought in grocery stores . -lrb- it h as a more meaty less-smooth texture -rrb- if you use the right tofu it wo n't fall of the skewer .	1
Wow! This one should convert people to tofu! Very cheap to make and a lot more filling than they look. And gorge all you like - they are really healthy!

The sauce is delicious and can be used with other ingredients. Typically the first time I make a new recipe I follow the directions exactly then I tweek it the next time. With this recipe I left out the jalapeno so that I could have a base from which to determine if/how much jalapeno I'd use the next time. I also had some doubts about the tofu staying on the skewers so I doubled the sauce recipe and marinated shrimp in a separate container. I skewered the shrimp and veggies and used a grilling basket for the tofu and veggies. I also made one skewer with the tofu as per the recipe and the tofu fell off. This meal was an instant hit and the leftover portion served cold over spinach the next night was just a delicious. It's a simple meal to prepare and make.	the sauce is delicious and can be used with other ingredients . typically the first time i make a new recipe i follow the directions exactly then i tweek it the next time . with this recipe i left out t he jalapeno so that i could have a base from which to determine if/how much jalapeno i 'd use the next time . i also had some doubts about the tofu staying on the skewers so i doubled the sauce recipe a nd marinated shrimp in a separate container . i skewered the shrimp and veggies and used a grilling basket for the tofu and veggies . i also made one skewer with the tofu as per the recipe and the tofu fell off . this meal was an instant hit and the leftover portion served cold over spinach the next night was just a delicious . it 's a simple meal to prepare and make .	1

This is the first time I tried cooking with tofu. My husband and I are trying to add more vegetarian meals to our diet. We prepared as per the recipe and we all liked it that includes my son and his girlfriend. Next time we will grill tofu longer since it was our first time we were afraid to overcook the tofu but the smaller more crisper chunks were a better texture.

Oh good Lord- yummy yummy yummy! I had plain Sriracha instead of garlic sriracha so I added a whole bunch of minced garlic. Used onion powder instead of fresh onion. After I tossed the tofu and veggies with the marinade I couldn't stop eating the raw tofu! The marinade is to die for! My carnivore husband went crazy over it too! Healthy and delicious.	oh good lord - yummy yummy yummy ! i had plain sriracha instead of garlic sriracha so i added a whole bunch of minced garlic . used onion powder instead of fresh onion . after i tossed the tofu and veggie s with the marinade i could n't stop eating the raw tofu ! the marinade is to die for ! my carnivore husband went crazy over it too ! healthy and delicious .	1
We love this one. I used Kikkoman Gluten free teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce to make it less salty. I also added sesame seeds and red pepper flakes in place of the jalapeños. I never seem to have them on hand! Draining freezing and then thawing tofu gives it a meaty texture and will keep it on the skewers so try that. Really good recipe and another great excuse to use Sriracha!	we love this one . i used kikkoman gluten free teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce to make it less salty . i also added sesame seeds and red pepper flakes in place of the jalapeños . i never seem to have them on hand ! draining freezing and then thawing tofu gives it a meaty texture and will keep it on the skewers so try that . really good recipe and another great excuse to use sriracha !	1
Amazing! I absolutely loved this! I am a huge fan of Sriracha sauce and not only did I marinated the tofu and veggies for a few hours in this delicious mariande but I added more Sriracha on top of mine! The hotter the better. My only changes were to use 1 tblspn of sesame oil and 1 tblspn of olive oil I used orange pepper and baby bella mushrooms with the zucchini....next time I will also add some chunks of vidalia onion to the skewers.

I made the scramble part and it was very delicious! I added mushrooms, tomatoes, onion and cilantro and put it on garbanzo beans I had made previously. The hub said it was fantastic! If I had really read the instructions b4 making it I would've cooked the garbanzo beans according to the recipe and it would've been even more tasty. A tip for cooking with tofu is extra firm cut through the middle so you have two flat thin pieces salting and peppering and leaving it cut side down in a colander to strain while u prep everything else. This will cut down on the cook time as well as a lot of the moisture will drain off before you even cook it. This is what I do whenever I want a firmer tofu. You can also put something on top to weigh it down.	i made the scramble part and it was very delicious ! i added mushrooms , tomatoes , onion and cilantro and put it on garbanzo beans i had made previously . the hub said it was fantastic ! if i had really r ead the instructions b4 making it i would 've cooked the garbanzo beans according to the recipe and it would 've been even more tasty . a tip for cooking with tofu is extra firm cut through the middle so you have two flat thin pieces salting and peppering and leaving it cut side down in a colander to strain while u prep everything else . this will cut down on the cook time as well as a lot of the mois ture will drain off before you even cook it . this is what i do whenever i want a firmer tofu . you can also put something on top to weigh it down .	1
I am obsessed with this recipe!  I make a big batch of this on Sunday and pack it in individual containers to have for breakfast all week long.  It is amazing made just as listed, but I have tweaked it to suit my own needs.  I use shredded sweet potato hash browns, instead of the potato, and I omit the tomatoes and add chopped zucchini and mushrooms.  I sometimes add chopped red bell pepper as well. The spices really make this dish.

I never like tofu particularly but our daughter is vegan. I've made this several times now for my husband and daughter and me and it is superb. The tofu turmeric looks just like scrambled eggs. The only change I made is to sub in pinto beans for the black beans as a matter of preference.

First time cooking tofu. It does have the same texture as scrambled eggs. This dish is heavy on protein so try not to eat too much. I didn't have cilantro but most of this just felt like bulky food in a bowl. I'd make it again but definitely recommend the hot sauce. Does need a bit more flavor in there or just heavier seasoning.	first time cooking tofu . it does have the same texture as scrambled eggs . this dish is heavy on protein so try not to eat too much . i did n't have cilantro but most of this just felt like bulky food in a bowl . i 'd make it again but definitely recommend the hot sauce . does need a bit more flavor in there or just heavier seasoning .	1
I have made this recipe twice, the first time with no changes, and it was very good. The second time, I made the following revisions and it was even better:1) DO NOT put tofu in water. 2) Season dry  sliced tofu with salt & pepper. 3) Dredge slices in white flour seasoned with salt & pepper. 3) Dredge tofu in beaten egg seasoned with salt & pepper until completely coated. 4) Dip in seasoned bread crumbs. 5) Cook tofu according to recipe instruction.  6) Spread a small layer of tomato sauce in bottom of lightly oiled baking dish. 7) Place tofu in dish, cover with tomato sauce, sprinkle with cheeses, and bake.   Sprinkle with chopped parsley when you take it out of the oven.	i have made this recipe twice , the first time with no changes , and it was very good . the second time , i made the following revisions and it was even better :1 -rrb- do not put tofu in water . 2 -rrb- season dry sliced tofu with salt & pepper . 3 -rrb- dredge slices in white flour seasoned with salt & pepper . 3 -rrb- dredge tofu in beaten egg seasoned with salt & pepper until completely coated . 4 -rrb- dip in seasoned bread crumbs . 5 -rrb- cook tofu according to recipe instruction . 6 -rrb- spread a small layer of tomato sauce in bottom of lightly oiled baking dish . 7 -rrb- place tofu in dish , cover with tomato sauce , sprinkle with che eses , and bake . sprinkle with chopped parsley when you take it out of the oven .	1
I love this recipe... I'm eating leftovers for lunch right now.  Some very important changes:  After slicing the tofu, press the slices gently between paper towels to drain the water.  Then BAKE IT on a nonstick sheet until it begins to turn golden. You will thank me. Yes, I bake it before frying it... the baking is not instead of frying.  the extra step just makes the texture SO much better... I cook w/ tofu in this way alot. Also, like other reviewers said, I dip the tofu slices in egg before breading and have NO issues w/ the breading coming off while frying.	i love this recipe ... i 'm eating leftovers for lunch right now . some very important changes : after slicing the tofu , press the slices gently between paper towels to drain the water . then bake it on a nonstick sheet until it begins to turn golden . you will thank me . yes , i bake it before frying it ... the baking is not instead of frying . the extra step just makes the texture so much better ... i cook w / tofu in this way alot . also , like other reviewers said , i dip the tofu slices in egg before breading and have no issues w / the breading coming off while frying .	1
This was super easy and quick to make, and very tasty!  To get good bread crumb coating on the tofu without using eggs or oil, I first pressed the tofu into the breadcrumbs, then sprayed each piece all over with cooking spray and then pressed the tofu into the crumb mixture again--this worked well.  I also fried the tofu with cooking spray.  The result was a delicious, non-greasy dish!  I would definitely make this again!	this was super easy and quick to make , and very tasty ! to get good bread crumb coating on the tofu without using eggs or oil , i first pressed the tofu into the breadcrumbs , then sprayed each piece al l over with cooking spray and then pressed the tofu into the crumb mixture again -- this worked well . i also fried the tofu with cooking spray . the result was a delicious , non-greasy dish ! i would de finitely make this again !	1

I made this sandwich last night for my sister.  I'm vegan- and I also don't use or like mayo. I put a bit more soy sauce on the tofu.

An array of flavours makes for a nice sandwich here. The tahini really makes this sandwich. I didn't have pita bread so I used whole grain gluten free sandwich bread. I also drained the tofu and lightly grilled it. The only issue for me was that it only gets toasted on one side under the broiler. Next time I will lightly toast the bread before assembling the sandwich. Do not pass up this sandwich it will not let you down.

I made this for Thanksgiving and although it was a lot of work it tasted soooo good!

i write a mixed review the dish takes a while but is easy (a tad bit expensive). I didn't use her stuffing recipe but did follow the tofu/body part. don't hollow the tofu out create the interior cavity as the refrigerated tofu is being pressed by placing a round bottomed bowl in the tofu as a form. The tofu also needs a better marinade recipe it was pretty wimpy (and salty). I also tried to impregnate the tofu w/herbs & soaked it for a long long time and that seemed to work better. good luck.	i write a mixed review the dish takes a while but is easy -lrb- a tad bit expensive -rrb- . i did n't use her stuffing recipe but did follow the tofu/body part . do n't hollow the tofu out create the interior cavit y as the refrigerated tofu is being pressed by placing a round bottomed bowl in the tofu as a form . the tofu also needs a better marinade recipe it was pretty wimpy -lrb- and salty -rrb- . i also tried to impreg nate the tofu w/herbs & soaked it for a long long time and that seemed to work better . good luck .	1

Great! I served them with quinoa and black beans (from this site) and sprinkled a little soy all over. We both had seconds and wanted thirds! If you want the tofu a little more dense (than even the extra firm) cut it up marinade in the veg broth and stick it in the freezer for a while. You can leave it there for at least a couple weeks and it becomes more dense. (Freeze in a single layer until frozen) This goes for any tofu recipe especially those that go on the grill!	great ! i served them with quinoa and black beans -lrb- from this site -rrb- and sprinkled a little soy all over . we both had seconds and wanted thirds ! if you want the tofu a little more dense -lrb- than even the ex tra firm -rrb- cut it up marinade in the veg broth and stick it in the freezer for a while . you can leave it there for at least a couple weeks and it becomes more dense . -lrb- freeze in a single layer until fro zen -rrb- this goes for any tofu recipe especially those that go on the grill !	1
My husband downed these tofu nuggets! I did make changes: I used some cornstarch instead of yeast; I also added some garlic powder to the flour. I didn't soak them in broth first so they kept more tofu flavor (my husband loves it). I fried them in a mix of peanut and sesame oil and we dipped them in 2 sauces--one was a soy sauce/lemon juice mix and the other was like marinara sauce.

My first attempt at making tofu and it turned out great thanks to this recipe! Per the Mock Chicken recipe I put the tofu in the freezer until a day before I needed it when I let it thaw in the refrigerator instead of simmering it in hot water like the recipe indicated. Wrapped in a dish towel I am able to squeeze out a fair amount of liquid without having to place a heavy object on it like I have seen suggested. I did make the mistake of buying firm instead of extra firm tofu but it did not cause any problems. These turned out great crunchy and tasty on the outside with a chicken like texture on the inside. Definitely keeping this one!	my first attempt at making tofu and it turned out great thanks to this recipe ! per the mock chicken recipe i put the tofu in the freezer until a day before i needed it when i let it thaw in the refrig erator instead of simmering it in hot water like the recipe indicated . wrapped in a dish towel i am able to squeeze out a fair amount of liquid without having to place a heavy object on it like i have seen suggested . i did make the mistake of buying firm instead of extra firm tofu but it did not cause any problems . these turned out great crunchy and tasty on the outside with a chicken like texture on the inside . definitely keeping this one !	1

Not a typical tofu eater. Tried this recipe because we are trying to incorporate less meat and more protein foods into our diet. Plus my youngest is allergic to pretty much everything. I altered a little with rice flour & used cornstarch. no cayenne pepper. They came out crispy and needing a little salt but good. I will probably use a soy sauce/ lemon mixture to dip them into.	not a typical tofu eater . tried this recipe because we are trying to incorporate less meat and more protein foods into our diet . plus my youngest is allergic to pretty much everything . i altered a lit tle with rice flour & used cornstarch . no cayenne pepper . they came out crispy and needing a little salt but good . i will probably use a soy sauce / lemon mixture to dip them into .	1

STUFFED SHELLS. SO GOOD! MADE IT TWICE NOW. THE GUESTS LIKED IT TOO! ONE REVIEW SAID YOU COULD DO VINEGAR INSTEAD OF LEMON SO I DID. AND FORGOT THE NOOCH BOTH TIMES.

PERFECT!	stuffed shells . so good ! made it twice now . the guests liked it too ! one review said you could do vinegar instead of lemon so i did . and forgot the nooch both times . added 2 c sautéed spinach to cheese mixture both times . perfect !	1
This worked beautifully in a homemade lasagna. Works well with substitutions too! I also added about a tablespoon of whey powder for a more full/convincing dairy taste. My boyfriend thought it was cheese! win!:) UPDATE: I actually prefer this using vinegar instead of the lemon juice. Also nutritional yeast pretty much makes everything better.;)	this worked beautifully in a homemade lasagna . works well with substitutions too ! i also added about a tablespoon of whey powder for a more full/convincing dairy taste . my boyfriend thought it was che ese ! win ! :-rrb- update : i actually prefer this using vinegar instead of the lemon juice . also nutritional yeast pretty much makes everything better. ;-rrb-	1

The recipe is bland without some changes. I made the following changes and it was fabulous. I added to the sauce mixture: 1 tsp basil 1 tsp italian seasoning 2 cloves garlic 1 c. lowfat ricotta 1 sauteed zucchini 1 1/2 c. sauteed mushrooms 1/2 pack frozen spinach and increased the spaghetti sauce to 2 cups increased salt to 1/2 teaspoon.	the recipe is bland without some changes . i made the following changes and it was fabulous . i added to the sauce mixture : 1 tsp basil 1 tsp italian seasoning 2 cloves garlic 1 c. lowfat ricotta 1 saut eed zucchini 1 1/2 c. sauteed mushrooms 1/2 pack frozen spinach and increased the spaghetti sauce to 2 cups increased salt to 1/2 teaspoon .	1
This receipe exceded my expectations. I took some of the other reviewer's advice and added fresh onions and garlic to my sauce as well as doubling the cheese and using a whole jar of sauce. Perfect! If you like your lasagna juicy and cheesy you must use more cheese and definitely a whole jar of sauce. I also used whole wheat lasagna instead of semolina fat free mozz cheese and fat free pasta sauce (no one was the wiser that's how good it was). Definitely freezes well which is great when you are cooking for 1. Next time will definitely add some spinach to the mix!	this receipe exceded my expectations . i took some of the other reviewer 's advice and added fresh onions and garlic to my sauce as well as doubling the cheese and using a whole jar of sauce . perfect ! i f you like your lasagna juicy and cheesy you must use more cheese and definitely a whole jar of sauce . i also used whole wheat lasagna instead of semolina fat free mozz cheese and fat free pasta sauce -lrb- no one was the wiser that 's how good it was -rrb- . definitely freezes well which is great when you are cooking for 1 . next time will definitely add some spinach to the mix !	1
I love tofu and I love lasagna... I never thought this would taste soooo GOOD. I made some modifications to it based on other users reviews. First I sprayed my pan with PAM. In a large mixing bowl I added a block of firm tofu (dried off w/ paper towel) 2 eggs a couple gulgs of organic milk kosher salt italian seasoning garlic powder basil nutmeg blk pepper mozz cheese 3 cloves of fresh garlic chopped and 1/2 a jar of Bertolli olive oil and mushroom sauce. I smashed it all together for the ricotta consistency and then put this tofu mixture as my bottom layer. I had 3 layers of noodles. On my 1st layer I put some sauce from the jar and some cheese; then the tofu mixture then sauce/cheese. I never measure my spices. Just pour in a whole bunch cuz it tastes so good (or eyeball it as Rachel Ray would say)! Next time I may add some Boca ground meat sauteed in EVOO and garlic and add it as one of my layers. Spinach sounds good too. I bet my tofu-phobic husband will never know this lasagna was made with tofu! Thanks for the great recipe! UPDATE: I successfully tricked my husband. He LOVED the lasagna so I do not think I will ruin it for him by telling him about the tofu. One thing I would probably try differently next time is to use plain sauce (not the tofu/sauce mixture) for the bottom layer.	i love tofu and i love lasagna ... i never thought this would taste soooo good . i made some modifications to it based on other users reviews . first i sprayed my pan with pam . in a large mixing bowl i a dded a block of firm tofu -lrb- dried off w / paper towel -rrb- 2 eggs a couple gulgs of organic milk kosher salt italian seasoning garlic powder basil nutmeg blk pepper mozz cheese 3 cloves of fresh garlic chop ped and 1/2 a jar of bertolli olive oil and mushroom sauce . i smashed it all together for the ricotta consistency and then put this tofu mixture as my bottom layer . i had 3 layers of noodles . on my 1 s t layer i put some sauce from the jar and some cheese ; then the tofu mixture then sauce/cheese . i never measure my spices . just pour in a whole bunch cuz it tastes so good -lrb- or eyeball it as rachel ray would say -rrb- ! next time i may add some boca ground meat sauteed in evoo and garlic and add it as one of my layers . spinach sounds good too . i bet my tofu-phobic husband will never know this lasagna was made with tofu ! thanks for the great recipe ! update : i successfully tricked my husband . he loved the lasagna so i do not think i will ruin it for him by telling him about the tofu . one thing i would probably try differently next time is to use plain sauce -lrb- not the tofu/sauce mixture -rrb- for the bottom layer .	1
I made this recipe for my meat-eating gf and myself. I was surprised at how much it makes. I had plenty of leftovers. However I strongly recommend that you follow what other reviews have suggested: a) use spaghetti sauce (I used a garlic & tomato one which was good) b) DOUBLE the amount of ingredients in the SAUCE mixture (I even think you could more than double it as I started to run out). I didn t use tofu but instead a meat substitute (Quorn Crumbles). It is a good recipe and my gf was surprised that it tasted so good. Next time I think I will add more (onions garlic maybe some vegetables). Even the leftovers were good (I ate it all myself)	i made this recipe for my meat-eating gf and myself . i was surprised at how much it makes . i had plenty of leftovers . however i strongly recommend that you follow what other reviews have suggested : a -rrb- use spaghetti sauce -lrb- i used a garlic & tomato one which was good -rrb- b -rrb- double the amount of ingredients in the sauce mixture -lrb- i even think you could more than double it as i started to run out -rrb- . i didn t use tofu but instead a meat substitute -lrb- quorn crumbles -rrb- . it is a good recipe and my gf was surprised that it tasted so good . next time i think i will add more -lrb- onions garlic maybe some vegetables -rrb- . even the leftovers were good -lrb- i ate it all myself -rrb-	1

I doubled the amount of curry powder (standard for any Indian cooking) and it was still too bland. Might have been better with a sliced orange pepper or nuts as others have suggested.

This recipe obeys the 4 flavors in Thai food: sweet salty sour hot. Nice. It also has great textures. Many reviewers suggested pressing tofu before use. I agree but went one step further. Since the tofu is not to be cooked and there's a raw beany taste to uncooked tofu I microwaved the tofu on LOW for a few minutes until it was very hot throughout before pressing and draining. I also subbed garlic powder for the crushed garlic b/c I'm not crazy about a strong raw garlic taste and I put the shredded cabbage aside to be used as a bed under the marinated ingredients. Really enjoyed the resulting almost no-cook summer dish.	this recipe obeys the 4 flavors in thai food : sweet salty sour hot . nice . it also has great textures . many reviewers suggested pressing tofu before use . i agree but went one step further . since the to fu is not to be cooked and there 's a raw beany taste to uncooked tofu i microwaved the tofu on low for a few minutes until it was very hot throughout before pressing and draining . i also subbed garlic powder for the crushed garlic b/c i 'm not crazy about a strong raw garlic taste and i put the shredded cabbage aside to be used as a bed under the marinated ingredients . really enjoyed the resulting almost no-cook summer dish .	1

I'm not one for tofu usually but this salad was really good and even better the next day once you let all of the veggies absorb the dressing. Made a few changes: we added in a bit of sea salt and left the snow peas raw which I think makes it even better. They're crunchier that way. The recipe can easily be doubled and next time I think we'll take it on a picnic.

it was really good as a base soup although i admit that i had to make a few adjustments. i added lots of green vegetables and only kept the water/stock to 6 cups not 12. in making it i really feel that 12 cups would make it way too thin.	it was really good as a base soup although i admit that i had to make a few adjustments . i added lots of green vegetables and only kept the water/stock to 6 cups not 12 . in making it i really feel tha t 12 cups would make it way too thin .	1

This is a nice simple soup that i enjoyed and will make again. I have a warning for all people who read these reviews though. Keep the broth at 12 cups if you use egg noodles. I reduced the broth to 8 cups and those noodles soaked it right up. after two bowls there wasn't any broth left! Thanks for a good recipe.

This is a good soup recipe. Nothing too fancy but very tasty. I made it once with the raisins and once without. It is good both ways but I think I prefer it without.

Unreal. I can't believe there's only 2 tbs of butter in this! I forwent the raisins like a few others. I also didn't have the fake chicken broth so I used 6 chicken flavored bullion cubes (fake chicken vegetarian cubes). I also used only 10 cups of water added another cup of egg noodles and the last of my frozen peas (about a cup and a half) it came out just the right consistency.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I made it last night for a Monday night dinner and not only is it easy enough for a weeknight but my husband loved it. I used the dumpling noodles which I love anyway and used vegetable broth because I couldn't find the kind called for in the recipe. I added more salt because my broth didn't have a whole lot. As for the other seasonings I really only used the poultry seasoning and black pepper (and a bit of thyme.) I also added peas because I thought they looked pretty. And one more change - I sauteed the tofu with the veggies for just a bit to give it some flavor. My husband usually HATES celery so I left it big enough for him to pick out but he wound up liking it. I didn't have to use the cornstarch mixture but I could see how it would be a nice thickening agent if your soup was thin. I will most certainly be making this recipe again and again this fall and winter especially since I keep most of the ingredients on hand. A soup that's this easy is always nice to have in the arsenal.

There is nothing wrong with this recipe but be forewarned: It is NOT a recipe for Ma Po Tofu. First of all Ma Po Tofu's main flavor is the Sichuan peppercorn. Seriously this is the main flavor of the dish... yet it doesn't appear in the list of ingredients. It's like someone who doesn't know how to cook chinese food ordered it once and tried to copy it without having any knowledge of Sichuan cuisine. Many of the other ingredients do correspond to the ingredients of the original dish but dry sherry green peas and cayenne pepper would never appear in the restaurant version. Thus I have provided a 3 review not because the dish is particularly bad but because it might mislead someone into thinking that the dish they were making would turn out to taste like Ma Po Tofu -- it will not and you will be disappointed.	there is nothing wrong with this recipe but be forewarned : it is not a recipe for ma po tofu . first of all ma po tofu 's main flavor is the sichuan peppercorn . seriously this is the main flavor of the dish ... yet it does n't appear in the list of ingredients . it 's like someone who does n't know how to cook chinese food ordered it once and tried to copy it without having any knowledge of sichuan cuisi ne . many of the other ingredients do correspond to the ingredients of the original dish but dry sherry green peas and cayenne pepper would never appear in the restaurant version . thus i have provided a 3 review not because the dish is particularly bad but because it might mislead someone into thinking that the dish they were making would turn out to taste like ma po tofu -- it will not and you wil l be disappointed .	1
This was great! I used beef instead of pork like my local noodle-house does. I also added a finely chopped half-onion and added a bit of white pepper and a dab of sesame oil. I probably used a whole thumbs-length of fresh ginger finely chopped. I served it over rice with broccoli on the side. I'd never sliced soft tofu before - it's so easy! two cuts horizontally then slice as on a grid. Very nice texture - creamy and soft. I tried not to stir the mixture too much as it heated so some of the tofu would retain its shape.	this was great ! i used beef instead of pork like my local noodle-house does . i also added a finely chopped half-onion and added a bit of white pepper and a dab of sesame oil . i probably used a whole t humbs-length of fresh ginger finely chopped . i served it over rice with broccoli on the side . i 'd never sliced soft tofu before - it 's so easy ! two cuts horizontally then slice as on a grid . very nice texture - creamy and soft . i tried not to stir the mixture too much as it heated so some of the tofu would retain its shape .	1
Delicious. I've made this dish many times and the BF (who is not normally a tofu fan) and I always gobble it up. For those of you have trouble finding fermented black beans - the black bean paste/sauce that comes in a jar works great (you should be able to find it at the Ethinc Food isle at your grocery store). I serve this plain white rice and I like to double the sauce b/c love having it over my rice. I also use sliced waterchestnuts instead of peas for some extra crunch (and b/c the BF doesn't like peas but loves waterchestnuts). Another tip - I once subbed beef broth for the chicken broth b/c I'd ran out of the latter and it tasted great as well - richer in fact. So when you feel like having a richer tofu dish use beef broth. Otherwise chicken broth is just fine.	delicious . i 've made this dish many times and the bf -lrb- who is not normally a tofu fan -rrb- and i always gobble it up . for those of you have trouble finding fermented black beans - the black bean paste/sauc e that comes in a jar works great -lrb- you should be able to find it at the ethinc food isle at your grocery store -rrb- . i serve this plain white rice and i like to double the sauce b/c love having it over my rice . i also use sliced waterchestnuts instead of peas for some extra crunch -lrb- and b/c the bf does n't like peas but loves waterchestnuts -rrb- . another tip - i once subbed beef broth for the chicken broth b/c i 'd ran out of the latter and it tasted great as well - richer in fact . so when you feel like having a richer tofu dish use beef broth . otherwise chicken broth is just fine .	1

I thought this was OK maybe a little dry. My 10 yr old loves it though. No one knew about the tofu either. I used extra firm tofu and pressed it dry then mashed it up with the cheese. I then added in garlic oregano basil. I shredded the carrots and zucchini and boiled them for a couple of minutes before adding in. I didn't use the whole box of shells but it gave me a full 9x13 pan worth. I topped it with a roasted garlic and onion jarred pasta sauce for the flavor.	i thought this was ok maybe a little dry . my 10 yr old loves it though . no one knew about the tofu either . i used extra firm tofu and pressed it dry then mashed it up with the cheese . i then added in garlic oregano basil . i shredded the carrots and zucchini and boiled them for a couple of minutes before adding in . i did n't use the whole box of shells but it gave me a full 9 x13 pan worth . i topped it with a roasted garlic and onion jarred pasta sauce for the flavor .	1

The filling is excellent mild perfectly textured and tasty. Be careful when adding or substituting vegetables that you drain everything very well. I recommend blending the tofu ricotta and egg until smooth before stirring in the carrot mixture and cheeses. I used 2 jars of spinach spaghetti sauce and pepperoni crumbles and tons more cheese. Makes more than 4 servings though - maybe 6.	the filling is excellent mild perfectly textured and tasty . be careful when adding or substituting vegetables that you drain everything very well . i recommend blending the tofu ricotta and egg until s mooth before stirring in the carrot mixture and cheeses . i used 2 jars of spinach spaghetti sauce and pepperoni crumbles and tons more cheese . makes more than 4 servings though - maybe 6 .	1

Honestly very bland. Needs more spices and I think this would be good. The texture of the tofu if you blend it really good fits right in and you'll never know its there. The tofu really needs a lot of seasoning though so don't be scared of the spices & herbs.	honestly very bland . needs more spices and i think this would be good . the texture of the tofu if you blend it really good fits right in and you 'll never know its there . the tofu really needs a lot of seasoning though so do n't be scared of the spices & herbs .	1
This dish was phenomenal!!! I followed the directions exactly and it turned out great. It would even be great over rice. This recipe deserves all 5 stars. I'm annoyed by reading reviews that alter a recipe and then knock down the rating because of the changes.

This was delicious. The only thing I changed was that after reading the reviews I decided to start with one pepper which ended up being perfect for our tastes. I also left out the garlic due to a food insensitivity. I loved this and am looking forward to making it again.	this was delicious . the only thing i changed was that after reading the reviews i decided to start with one pepper which ended up being perfect for our tastes . i also left out the garlic due to a food insensitivity . i loved this and am looking forward to making it again .	1
Fantastic! I felt like I was at an Indian restaurant. I did not have all of the spices so I did without the coriander and cilantro. This is a spicy recipe so if you like things mild you should probably cut out the cayenne completely and maybe reduce the serrano. I served with homemade naan from this site and got rave reviews from my friends. Also as you may have guessed this makes way more than 4 servings for the average person.	fantastic ! i felt like i was at an indian restaurant . i did not have all of the spices so i did without the coriander and cilantro . this is a spicy recipe so if you like things mild you should probabl y cut out the cayenne completely and maybe reduce the serrano . i served with homemade naan from this site and got rave reviews from my friends . also as you may have guessed this makes way more than 4 servings for the average person .	1
This was a great dish. We are vegan so I substituted the yogurt for vegan sour cream mixed with a little soy milk. That worked wonderfully. Using soy milk in place of the half and half did not work as well the milk curdled. The tofu was a bit too spicy for my kids and next time I will probably cut the amount of spices in half.

This wasn't a BAD dish but I expected more flavor. With all the cumin corriander ginger and marsala I was dissapointed with the blandness. I did enjoy the texture of the tufo baking it prior t adding it I believe is a great idea. Also it was kinda ugly with the tofu and cauliflower being white the sauce turns everything kinda reddish brown.	this was n't a bad dish but i expected more flavor . with all the cumin corriander ginger and marsala i was dissapointed with the blandness . i did enjoy the texture of the tufo baking it prior t adding it i believe is a great idea . also it was kinda ugly with the tofu and cauliflower being white the sauce turns everything kinda reddish brown .	1

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe. The dressing is lacking something maybe more brown sugar lime and ginger and a little oil? Also the dressing just runs to the bottom of the bowl the noodles didn't soak up the dressing even after having sat in the refrigerator overnight. (Another reviewer suggested some peanut butter in the dressing which is an excellent idea.) It is a difficult salad to plate and eat with the noodles being so long - I would break up the noodles a little before soaking them. I did serve this with grilled chicken but I used the recipe for Shoyu Chicken for the marinade for the chicken.	i was a bit disappointed with this recipe . the dressing is lacking something maybe more brown sugar lime and ginger and a little oil ? also the dressing just runs to the bottom of the bowl the noodles did n't soak up the dressing even after having sat in the refrigerator overnight . -lrb- another reviewer suggested some peanut butter in the dressing which is an excellent idea . -rrb- it is a difficult salad to plate and eat with the noodles being so long - i would break up the noodles a little before soaking them . i did serve this with grilled chicken but i used the recipe for shoyu chicken for the marinade for the chicken .	1
Wowee was I popular at the barbecue on Sunday! I made this great salad - it's sooooo easy and delicious! I made as is but for one thing: I substituted diced green peppers for the green onions as my Boo hates onions but I put them on the side with some extra crushed peanuts so that people could add garnish to their own salads. This one is definitely a keeper. (BTW Trader Joe's has pre-shredded carrots which makes it even EASIER!).	wowee was i popular at the barbecue on sunday ! i made this great salad - it 's sooooo easy and delicious ! i made as is but for one thing : i substituted diced green peppers for the green onions as my bo o hates onions but i put them on the side with some extra crushed peanuts so that people could add garnish to their own salads . this one is definitely a keeper . -lrb- btw trader joe 's has pre-shredded carr ots which makes it even easier ! -rrb- .	1
I have loved this salad for years - thanks for the recipe. I find that tossing the noodles in the dressing them laying them out on a cookie sheet topped with the veggies makes mixing everything together well much easier. I also add a splash of toasted sesame oil to the soaking water - the noodles then don't stick together and drain off the water better.	i have loved this salad for years - thanks for the recipe . i find that tossing the noodles in the dressing them laying them out on a cookie sheet topped with the veggies makes mixing everything togeth er well much easier . i also add a splash of toasted sesame oil to the soaking water - the noodles then do n't stick together and drain off the water better .	1
I LOVED this salad! So refreshing on a hot summer day. The carrots give a nice crunch and some added texture. I love Asian food but I've never used fish sauce before and I was a bit apprehensive. However all of the flavors work together perfectly. Don't be afraid! I think this salad is going to be in heavy rotation this summer at my house. I will say the rice noodles took forever to soften just sitting in hot water so I ended up boiling them and then hitting them with cold water and it was fine.	i loved this salad ! so refreshing on a hot summer day . the carrots give a nice crunch and some added texture . i love asian food but i 've never used fish sauce before and i was a bit apprehensive . howe ver all of the flavors work together perfectly . do n't be afraid ! i think this salad is going to be in heavy rotation this summer at my house . i will say the rice noodles took forever to soften just si tting in hot water so i ended up boiling them and then hitting them with cold water and it was fine .	1
Even my picky husband liked this and I thought for sure he would not. I used Thai Sweet Chili sauce and since it was so sweet (and spicy) I left out the brown sugar which was a good call. I added matchstick cut cucumber and left out the mint. Hubby can't eat cilantro so I served it on the side along with extra crushed peanuts (don't skip the peanuts!!) the more the better. I grilled shrimp to top the salad which was a great variation.

The only reason I gave this recipe even 2 stars is due to the sauce which I tweaked a little even. Added some lemongrass more sesame oil and ginger. However the noodles did not soften in the hot water which is what I was leary about in the first place. I think rice noodles need to be in boiling water for a minute to soften correctly.	the only reason i gave this recipe even 2 stars is due to the sauce which i tweaked a little even . added some lemongrass more sesame oil and ginger . however the noodles did not soften in the hot water which is what i was leary about in the first place . i think rice noodles need to be in boiling water for a minute to soften correctly .	1
Great recipe! I had two people from India helping me make it and they suggested these changes: more curry (they added about 8 tbls), fresh ground pepper, and use Indian Chili powder not cayenne and increase the amount to about 3 tsp. They said that cayenne is a western spice and Indian chili powder is more authentic. This made it VERY hot. We used the sauce to help spice up another mild curry dish we had.	great recipe ! i had two people from india helping me make it and they suggested these changes : more curry -lrb- they added about 8 tbls -rrb- , fresh ground pepper , and use indian chili powder not cayenne and in crease the amount to about 3 tsp . they said that cayenne is a western spice and indian chili powder is more authentic . this made it very hot . we used the sauce to help spice up another mild curry dish we had .	2
"I used this recipe when I made curry myself for the first time ever. I loved it! Absolutely wonderful. 

Having experimented with the recipe since that first experience, I suggest trying out a different first step. 

In a dry pot pre-heated to a medium heat, first roast the curry powder for a minute or until browned, stirring constantly. Add the paprika and the cinnamon, and ginger stirring constantly. (I do not add the sugar) Then add the garlic, bay leaf, and onions, and drizzle the olive oil over top. You can do this with about 1 1/2- 2tbsp. of olive oil. Continue as per the recipe. 

I found that that extra first step enriches the flavor of the curry powder and makes for a fuller-bodied/ slightly spicier curry.

A very nice Chicken Curry.  I also used 1 tsp. of Garam Masala.  I wish I had left out the lemon and the cayenne because I thought it tasted better before those were added.  I even cut down the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. because my youngest daughter doesn't like it too hot.  I think that next time I will omit the last two ingredients.  	a very nice chicken curry . i also used 1 tsp . of garam masala . i wish i had left out the lemon and the cayenne because i thought it tasted better before those were added . i even cut down the cayenn e to 1/4 tsp . because my youngest daughter does n't like it too hot . i think that next time i will omit the last two ingredients .	1
My first comment is to read through the rest of the reviews before making this dish. The recipe alone is a great starting place but you may want to take some of the suggestions you read to make it just right for you. Not everyone likes the same flavors so you need to tweak it specifically for your taste buds.

Excellent recipe. Loved the coconut flavor! I used boneless chicken thighs instead of breast and reduced to 1 tsp (actually 1 cube) of chicken bouillion to reduce sodium. Also used more butternut squash (about 2 cups) to increase the healthy vegetables.	excellent recipe . loved the coconut flavor ! i used boneless chicken thighs instead of breast and reduced to 1 tsp -lrb- actually 1 cube -rrb- of chicken bouillion to reduce sodium . also used more butternut squa sh -lrb- about 2 cups -rrb- to increase the healthy vegetables .	1
All of my family LOVED this I did let it simmer for a little longer than the recipe stated because the squash hadn't quite cooked through. It was nice cooking for the extra time because the chicken kind of fell apart in the sauce and the kids liked that. Very tasty served with buttered rice and greens.

This was absolutely wonderful. My husband is from the Caribbean so I was picturing a totally different result. In actuality it is more like a Thai dish.

Amazing recipe! Would have been worth 5 stars if followed exactly as written but felt like a few minor mods made it above and beyond delicious! Would use about half the suggested butternut amount next time. Before serving I added the juice of one lime (really brightened all the flavors) 1 tsp salt (also really brought out the flavors) and 1/4 teaspoon of Cayenne pepper which gave it just a little bit of a kick (the carribean seasoning we found wasn't spicy so taste before adding this in case yours is). Some reviewers mentioned that the flavors needed a bit more time to really meld so I opted to cook everything (except the chicken) in the crockpot on low all day. Then an hour before dinner I added the cubed chicken. The flavors and consistency were perfect!	amazing recipe ! would have been worth 5 stars if followed exactly as written but felt like a few minor mods made it above and beyond delicious ! would use about half the suggested butternut amount next time . before serving i added the juice of one lime -lrb- really brightened all the flavors -rrb- 1 tsp salt -lrb- also really brought out the flavors -rrb- and 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper which gave it just a little bit of a kick -lrb- the carribean seasoning we found was n't spicy so taste before adding this in case yours is -rrb- . some reviewers mentioned that the flavors needed a bit more time to really meld so i opted t o cook everything -lrb- except the chicken -rrb- in the crockpot on low all day . then an hour before dinner i added the cubed chicken . the flavors and consistency were perfect !	1

This has the potential of being great. I subbed Gardein for the chicken (pan-fried it and tossed it in at the end) and used faux chicken granules. I added a little fresh grated coconut for texture and cut the coconut milk in half. I think the only thing missing was the development of flavors (I think I'll let it simmer longer next time) and it definitely needed some acid (maybe a little lemon juice next time).	this has the potential of being great . i subbed gardein for the chicken -lrb- pan-fried it and tossed it in at the end -rrb- and used faux chicken granules . i added a little fresh grated coconut for texture and cut the coconut milk in half . i think the only thing missing was the development of flavors -lrb- i think i 'll let it simmer longer next time -rrb- and it definitely needed some acid -lrb- maybe a little lemon juic e next time -rrb- .	1

Excellent! I used Chef John's roasted chicken stock recipe and the schmalz (chicken fat) from the roasted chicken for making this soup. Next time I might try adding some frozen peas  at the same time that the chicken is added.	excellent ! i used chef john 's roasted chicken stock recipe and the schmalz -lrb- chicken fat -rrb- from the roasted chicken for making this soup . next time i might try adding some frozen peas at the same time that the chicken is added .	1
Awesome!!!

I always save my rotisserie ckn carcasses after I trim off the leftover meat @ freeze that in a separate pkg with the carcass. Broth is so much better when made with rotesserie ckn. Pretty much followed the recipe & added trimmings at the end.  Great way to use up rotisserie ckn & get a bigger bang for your buck. Your only expense is the price of the veggies & if you're like me you have them in the fridge anyways. A pot of soup for no extra cost!  If I'm not going to serve right away I cook the noodles separate.  If they're left in overnite they tend to swell & absorb the broth.  So I just toss them in when I'm reheating the soup.	i always save my rotisserie ckn carcasses after i trim off the leftover meat @ freeze that in a separate pkg with the carcass . broth is so much better when made with rotesserie ckn . pretty much follow ed the recipe & added trimmings at the end . great way to use up rotisserie ckn & get a bigger bang for your buck . your only expense is the price of the veggies & if you 're like me you have them in th e fridge anyways . a pot of soup for no extra cost ! if i 'm not going to serve right away i cook the noodles separate . if they 're left in overnite they tend to swell & absorb the broth . so i just tos s them in when i 'm reheating the soup .	1

Changed a couple of things.  Poached the chicken breasts with a little olive oil, celery and onion with chicken granules and four cups of water.  Brought it to a boil and then turned off the stove; one hour later perfectly poached chicken.  Shredded the chicken and sieved the ingredients from the broth.  Used the chicken and the broth with some homemade amish egg noodles; plus all other ingredients.  Did not have chicken fat so I used canola oil instead.  This was absolutely delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very tasty. Not as spicy as I expected with the cayenne pepper. Next time I will add more since we like spicy food. The green olives and capers give it an interesting slightly salty flavor so you might want to cut back on the added salt. Cumin was the predominant flavor. If you don't like cumin cut back on it but I wouldn't eliminate it altogether. The chicken was done through but not overcooked. If you watch Chef John's video you will notice that he uses less than a whole onion. Some of his other ingredients were less than what the recipe calls for. And he does not include the back pieces of the chicken. I did because I like those bony parts. All-in-all a good recipe and worth repeating. We are looking forward to leftovers since there only two of us and it makes a lot.	i followed the recipe exactly and it was very tasty . not as spicy as i expected with the cayenne pepper . next time i will add more since we like spicy food . the green olives and capers give it an inte resting slightly salty flavor so you might want to cut back on the added salt . cumin was the predominant flavor . if you do n't like cumin cut back on it but i would n't eliminate it altogether . the chic ken was done through but not overcooked . if you watch chef john 's video you will notice that he uses less than a whole onion . some of his other ingredients were less than what the recipe calls for . an d he does not include the back pieces of the chicken . i did because i like those bony parts . all-in-all a good recipe and worth repeating . we are looking forward to leftovers since there only two of u s and it makes a lot .	1

I was true to the recipe with the exception of using raisins instead of currants. The recipe is superb -- with a Moroccan or North African twist. Its blend of lamb spices almonds and currants (raisins) give it a mellow sweet crunchy and heady flavor. This is all offset by the juiciness of the cabbage roll braised slowly in a hint of tomato puree and silky chicken broth. It was a breeze to make using Chef John's tips for steaming the cabbage to remove the leaves plus his directions for shaping the meat into tiny loaves before stuffing and rolling the cabbage like a burrito.

I'm a stickler for following the recipe exactly so that it turns out right. I made this recipe and baked it at the recommended temperature and for the recommended time and the rice was NOT cooked through. The meat tasted fabulous but it was not edible because of the rice. In the past I have always precooked rice before adding it to cabbage rolls and I will do it that way if I ever make this recipe again.	i 'm a stickler for following the recipe exactly so that it turns out right . i made this recipe and baked it at the recommended temperature and for the recommended time and the rice was not cooked thro ugh . the meat tasted fabulous but it was not edible because of the rice . in the past i have always precooked rice before adding it to cabbage rolls and i will do it that way if i ever make this recipe again .	1
I am not an experienced cook. One of the primary reasons I love Chef John's recipes is that even someone like me  can still do them justice. I attempted to follow the directions exactly as outlined. Having never roasted peppers before, mine came out a little too crispy in the end. I believe this was my error and should have only halved my peppers rather than quartering. I sliced he onions as suggested and they burned to a crisp. I guess this is where my inexperience comes in. The chicken was perfect. Crispy skin but still moist and tender. I used Hot Italian sausage and that also came out beautifully and some of the heat made it's way into the chicken. All in all, loved this dish and will make it again. I will either add the onions later or maybe skip them altogether and have more of the sweet peppers.

This was simple and tasted great. I asked my wife before cooking it if she wanted any, and she declined, telling me to cut the recipe in half so I wouldn't have excessive leftovers. As it was roasting she was drawn to the kitchen and remarked that it smelled good. She returned later asking when it would be ready and did I make enough for her after all. When she saw it, she said it looked beautiful, and after eating it raved about how much she loved it. Oh, and I loved it too. I might add whole heirloom carrots next time and experiment around with red potatoes or something just for fun, but still great just as it is.	this was simple and tasted great . i asked my wife before cooking it if she wanted any , and she declined , telling me to cut the recipe in half so i would n't have excessive leftovers . as it was roasting she was drawn to the kitchen and remarked that it smelled good . she returned later asking when it would be ready and did i make enough for her after all . when she saw it , she said it looked beautiful , and after eating it raved about how much she loved it . oh , and i loved it too . i might add whole heirloom carrots next time and experiment around with red potatoes or something just for fun , but sti ll great just as it is .	1
This is divine!! My husband who rarely gives out compliments adored it. Definitely use a gorgeous Italian sausage. I don't know if Chef John intended using precooked or smoked types. The flavor from the sausage took this dish to decedent. And additional or various other veggies that work well roasted would make it even better. They're supposed to get a bit black (esp. sweet peppers) or brown and crisp. That's the goal. Then they're sweet and lovely. This dish is very easy short on time needed to preprep and really elegant. Great with crusty bread or a good green salad. Thanks John.	this is divine !! my husband who rarely gives out compliments adored it . definitely use a gorgeous italian sausage . i do n't know if chef john intended using precooked or smoked types . the flavor from t he sausage took this dish to decedent . and additional or various other veggies that work well roasted would make it even better . they 're supposed to get a bit black -lrb- esp . sweet peppers -rrb- or brown and c risp . that 's the goal . then they 're sweet and lovely . this dish is very easy short on time needed to preprep and really elegant . great with crusty bread or a good green salad . thanks john .	1
We LOVE this recipe. It is great when you have a crowd to feed. I generally don t brown the sausage ahead of time as I find it browns up just fine in the pan (and I use mild sausage so I don t get that oil anyway).

I rarely leave reviews but with this recipe I had to make an exception. First of all thank you Chef John. For everyone else. You REALLY need to try this recipe. I made it according to the directions but cut it down to 4 servings. I used two sweet & one hot Italian sausage. The next time (there WILL be a next time) I think I ll just try three spicy sausages. I used one large red bell pepper but I m thinkin you could use any kind of peppers or a combination of peppers including some spicy ones if you like it that way.	i rarely leave reviews but with this recipe i had to make an exception . first of all thank you chef john . for everyone else . you really need to try this recipe . i made it according to the directions b ut cut it down to 4 servings . i used two sweet & one hot italian sausage . the next time -lrb- there will be a next time -rrb- i think i ll just try three spicy sausages . i used one large red bell pepper but i m thinkin you could use any kind of peppers or a combination of peppers including some spicy ones if you like it that way .	1
Take my advice... watch chef John's video and make it exactly the way he tells you I can't stop eating this!! So delicious and simple and flavorful. You HAVE to use spicy sausage though sweet sausage doesn't give it that kick like the spicy does just cut them to 1-inch slices instead of two because wow it's spicy. Be generous with the salt but two teaspoons is a bit much. I kinda eyeballed it. I wish my supermarket sold organic chicken thighs skin on and bone in but I made an exception because I didn't want to sacrifice the flavor. Bon appetit!!	take my advice ... watch chef john 's video and make it exactly the way he tells you i ca n't stop eating this !! so delicious and simple and flavorful . you have to use spicy sausage though sweet sausage does n't give it that kick like the spicy does just cut them to 1 inch slices instead of two because wow it 's spicy . be generous with the salt but two teaspoons is a bit much . i kinda eyeballed it . i w ish my supermarket sold organic chicken thighs skin on and bone in but i made an exception because i did n't want to sacrifice the flavor . bon appetit !!	1

This was okay. Followed the recipe except I used mild Italian sausage because my husband doesn't like hot. In the end the chicken tasted just like chicken potatoes tasted just like potatoes and so on. Everything was moist but heavy on grease and oil.

Added half an onion and a clove of garlic when I put the chicken thighs in.  Also added fresh tomato right at the end of cook time.  I never pay much attention to exact measurements of salt/spices and I just kind of did my own thing so it was absolutely perfect and so easy!

Excellent! This reminded me of Spanish Paella. So I added a hand full of frozen peas at the end. Since we are senior citizens I always cut back on cayenne and crushed peppers in Chef Johns recipes also we use the milder sausages and his recipes always turn out to our satisfaction.

This was a pretty easy and tasty dish - since I had bone-in thighs I browned the chicken which I think really helped. Will probably make it again and when I do I'll probably add some more veggies to give it a little more life.	this was a pretty easy and tasty dish - since i had bone-in thighs i browned the chicken which i think really helped . will probably make it again and when i do i 'll probably add some more veggies to g ive it a little more life .	1
Absolutely delicious! I couldn't help adding some chopped onions and garlic before the browning of the sausage. Also I used what ever beef sausage my Halal store carries. My orzo took 5 more minutes to cook.

Good idea in theory; just way too salty as written. I think we will try again but will use low-sodium chicken broth and leave out the salt.	good idea in theory ; just way too salty as written . i think we will try again but will use low-sodium chicken broth and leave out the salt .	1

I made this last night and it came out amazing.. my boyfriend said it was a top dish. the only difference in this recipe is that I cooked all the veggies with the meat and I used two different sausages a spicy italian and a something else that wasnt so spicy ( a good mix) and insitead of shredding the chicken I just kept it as is. When I sauted the all of the veggies with the sausage it came it out very flavorfull.

My whole family loved this! I usually try to stay true to the original recipe the first time I make it but a few of the ingredients can't be found in my little town. I had Hillshire Farms Cheddarwurst on hand and substituted it for the linguica. I used one large jalapeno pepper and took the others reviewers suggestion and doubled the orzo and the flavors were amazing. Came out so good even my picky eater cleaned his plate. Smelled so good while it was cooking as well!

This is an excellent change up from the same old boring chicken! The spices really make this dish flavorful and the red bell pepper gives it color and a texture. Browning the chicken is a must because you get those great flavors left in the pan. I didn't have a bay leaf but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. If I was to make any change at all it would only be to pare back the amount of meat or increase the orzo.

This is excellent! I used bnls/sknls thighs & italian sausage as it's what I had on hand and a red & green bell pepper. Wasn't sure which paprika to use so used 1/2 hot 1/2 smoked. Didn't have orzo either used risotto. Now it seems I shouldn't even be rating this recipe since I didn't really make IT! Sorry...but the seasonings are what really made the dish and they are great. I liked having a lot of meat in it but I'm only feeding 2 - more pasta/rice is a definite budget stretcher. I will make this again and try orzo then. Thanks again Chef!

You know, I always dislike those reviews that say: I changed this, I changed that, etc. HOWEVER, I am going to post one like that because I didn't have all of the ingredients necessary for the dish. Very, very good, even with my changes and omissions. I'm sure it'd be even better. We don't like peppers and onions so I skipped those. I sprinkled a little onion powder in the mix. I was all out of Balsamic Vinegar so I used Red Wine Vinegar instead. I had no fresh herbs so I skipped those too. I'm sure if I had all the ingredients it would have been even better.

I really like this recipe i'm a vegetarian so I did a few substitutes (I use vegetable broth and no chicken. I also don't like olives so I didn't use any..) The recipe was still great and it's an awesome protein dish that I can throw together really quickly using whatever vegetables I have on hand. I have made a habit of making this dish in large quantities then refrigerating it so I can take it to work later in the week. It's the kinda dish that tastes as good or better on the second day.

Excellent!

O....M....G!!!!! DINNER LAST NIGHT WAS AMAZING! My husband and I LOVED this. He's not big on trying new things but when I told him about how healthy quinoa is and had a way to make it that he'd like he went for it. I read over the reviews to see what adjustments we could make and with them it was delicious! We omitted the salt used half the lemon juice and added chickpeas. I cooked the quinoa in vegetable broth and used red instead of green pepper (that's all I had). I also am weird about raw onions so when the chicken was almost done I threw in the onions so they could cook a little. We will definitely make this over and over again! Thanks a ton!!!

This was so good! That even my husband who doesn't even care for chicken loved it. I was looking for a recipe that was for chicken legs when I can across this recipe and I liked the ingredients. I did however change some things to what I had and because I was in a hurry. I used dehydrated onions and garlic and used!/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper instead of chili powder. I found out my cayenne pepper is really really hot and that is why I used only half the amount. So I can't wait to try this again with chicken breast like it calls for.

4 1/2 Stars- but I'll round up! Seriously one of the best Asian Chicken recipes I've ever made. The chicken was a perfect combination of sweet and spicy, the 1/2 star I took off was because I found the recipe a bit too salty.  I'm sure this will probably vary depending on the brands of soy/fish sauce you use.  I would start light on both then add if needed.  I made half a recipe for my boyfriend and I with a side of sesame green beans and brown rice. I was worried it wouldn't be enough food as I only had 3 chicken thighs, but it was perfect, if not too much food.  I had no troubles with the liquid ratio, but I did have a big pan with not much meat (and a gas stove). I would tend to think that maybe the people who are having trouble may be overcrowding the pan.  All in all this is a wow-worthy recipe, definitely suitable for company.

I am ONLY reviewing the sauce because I went in a different direction with my chicken. I used rotisserie chicken thighs and French cut green beans and almonds. I made the sauce exactly as written and just reduced it down, then added my chicken, green beans and almonds to heat through. Served over brown Jasmine rice with egg rolls on the side. The sauce is *wonderful* and would be good on just about any Asian-inspired sauce you chose to use it in. I will definitely make this again, maybe even as written sometime!

Sauce was the richest ever and the parsnips were wonderful. My butcher didn't have the required cut so I used some other cut and it was clearly far too lean. So try to get the right kind of cut with lots of fat inside the meat.	sauce was the richest ever and the parsnips were wonderful . my butcher did n't have the required cut so i used some other cut and it was clearly far too lean . so try to get the right kind of cut with l ots of fat inside the meat .	1

This was as fabulous as everyone said it would be - I ll definitely make it again! The only change and I think someone else mentioned this was the amount of fat that came off the lamb chops. This will depend on which chops you use but spooning the fat off didn t help. I ll use my gravy separater to get most of the fat off. Considering that you add butter at the end I don t think it will ruin the mouth feel of the sauce.	this was as fabulous as everyone said it would be - i ll definitely make it again ! the only change and i think someone else mentioned this was the amount of fat that came off the lamb chops . this will depend on which chops you use but spooning the fat off didn t help . i ll use my gravy separater to get most of the fat off . considering that you add butter at the end i don t think it will ruin the m outh feel of the sauce .	1
"I had friends over to help rake leaves today so I made them lunch.  I made the A La King this morning and just reheated at lunch time.  I served it over beds of brown rice (also re-heated) and a crisp salad.  HUGE likes! 
Everyone liked it very much.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  The next time I make it I will throw in another shallot and a clove or two of garlic.  Only because I would prefer it, not because the recipe needs it.

Ok so I grew up on Banquet frozen chicken a la king and my husband grew up on his dad's version of turkey a la king. I was hoping that 1) this would be close to what we grew up on and 2) that it would be phenomenal due to it being one of Chef John's recipes but after all the work to make it (no modifications other than used gluten free AP flour) and the resulting flavor I am disappointed. My husband said he would not want me to make it again and really I don't have any desire to. I served it over GF biscuits (figured toasted bread like in childhood was too plain for a meal that took this long to make). I really don't know what would make it be five stars. I guess I'll keep looking.	ok so i grew up on banquet frozen chicken a la king and my husband grew up on his dad 's version of turkey a la king . i was hoping that 1 -rrb- this would be close to what we grew up on and 2 -rrb- that it would be phenomenal due to it being one of chef john 's recipes but after all the work to make it -lrb- no modifications other than used gluten free ap flour -rrb- and the resulting flavor i am disappointed . my husba nd said he would not want me to make it again and really i do n't have any desire to . i served it over gf biscuits -lrb- figured toasted bread like in childhood was too plain for a meal that took this long to make -rrb- . i really do n't know what would make it be five stars . i guess i 'll keep looking .	1

I really liked this but I wanted to make it more substantial so I added some broccoli. I cooked the bacon then removed it from the pan. Then I cooked the broccoli in the bacon fat salt pepper and garlic. Then I threw in the beans and greens turned off the heat stirred for about 2mins added the lemon juice and stirred again. I served the bacon on top to keep it crispy.

As I faithfully followed the recipe my beans disintegrated leaving an almost hummus like paste. I don't know if my canned beans were over-cooked (at the bean factory) or if medium heat on my cooktop is calibrated differently than Chef John's. The flavors were interesting but not so spectacular that I'll spend time trying to figure things out. Thanks anyway Chef John. You are still my favorite.	as i faithfully followed the recipe my beans disintegrated leaving an almost hummus like paste . i do n't know if my canned beans were over-cooked -lrb- at the bean factory -rrb- or if medium heat on my cooktop i s calibrated differently than chef john 's . the flavors were interesting but not so spectacular that i 'll spend time trying to figure things out . thanks anyway chef john . you are still my favorite .	1

I changed a few things... use apples instead of pears as that was all I had, used Jack Daniels instead of Irish Whiskey, walnuts instead of hazelnuts and used chicken boullion instead of just water. I also tripled the whiskey amount, as my husband and I both love the taste of whiskey and the dish was not overpoweringly whiskey tasting. It was perfect!

"Made this tonight on a whim to use some sweet potatoes I had. I used some drumsticks instead just because I had them and it was great. 

 It was delicious! I would however make a few adjustments next time. I loved the pears and would add another. I would also double the spinach, since it cooks down so much.

I hate when people rate recipes after they've altered it, but I'm sure the original is just as good, if not better, than the version I made.  Based on what I had on hand, I used granny smith apples instead of pears, omitted the whiskey, and used toasted almonds instead of hazelnuts.  It was delicious!  Next time I will make it as written to see which version is better, but I'll leave the chicken out because I don't think it adds anything.	i hate when people rate recipes after they 've altered it , but i 'm sure the original is just as good , if not better , than the version i made . based on what i had on hand , i used granny smith apples in stead of pears , omitted the whiskey , and used toasted almonds instead of hazelnuts . it was delicious ! next time i will make it as written to see which version is better , but i 'll leave the chicken o ut because i do n't think it adds anything .	1

Good flavors but I felt like it was missing some depth. I'll add more whiskey next time and maybe chicken stock instead of water.

"Since writing this recipe I have changed to a skillet.  Brown chicken breasts on both sides in olive oil.  Squeeze 1/2 of a lemon over all.  Cover with lid over medium heat.  Cook til done.

Made this last night. It was simple enough but I highly recommend doubling the sauce for your recipe. In my case rather than using 6 breasts for the 4 serving size I used 3 breasts and left the sauce amount as is. There was barely enough for my reduced serving. Anyway the chicken came out beautifully. As other reviewers mentioned it could have used more flavor. I'll make sure to salt and pepper the breasts in the future. In addition the sauce could have used more flavor. I used half broth and half wine for my version. I also added garlic powder but it needed something more. Perhaps a bit of rosemary?? All in all I enjoyed the textures of everything just need to spice it up a bit in the future. My accompaniments were brown rice and asparagus.	made this last night . it was simple enough but i highly recommend doubling the sauce for your recipe . in my case rather than using 6 breasts for the 4 serving size i used 3 breasts and left the sauce amount as is . there was barely enough for my reduced serving . anyway the chicken came out beautifully . as other reviewers mentioned it could have used more flavor . i 'll make sure to salt and pepper th e breasts in the future . in addition the sauce could have used more flavor . i used half broth and half wine for my version . i also added garlic powder but it needed something more . perhaps a bit of ro semary ?? all in all i enjoyed the textures of everything just need to spice it up a bit in the future . my accompaniments were brown rice and asparagus .	1
This was very good. I took the suggestion and instead of putting it in the oven I just cooked it in a skillet. Also didn't have lemons so I just used lemon juice and also sprinkled Lemon Pepper seasoning. I used a whole can of Chicken Broth so I could have more gravy. Turned out great-- my whole family enjoyed this recipe.

EXCELLENT!! I am going to recommend this recipe to people. I put some asparagus in with the chicken while it baked and it soaked up the lemon flavor and tasted really good! I added some white wine with a cube of chicken boulion instead of chicken broth. It came out great and it was quite simple and is pretty fool proof.

I marinated the chicken in lemon juice and olive oil for about an hour before cooking in the skillet as suggested by other reviewers. It turned out wonderful. I also added 1 whole cup of chicken broth which yielded a nice amount of sauce for the chicken.

Very good recipe! I used a skillet as suggested then after chicken was done I put it in the oven to keep it warm.

I made as listed but probably should have trusted my instinct to tweak a bit. We all thought this was missing something. The chicken did turn out nice and moist with a pleasant lemon taste but if I were to make this again I'd definitely add minced garlic and perhaps marinate the chicken ahead of time so that it picks up a bit more flavor.	i made as listed but probably should have trusted my instinct to tweak a bit . we all thought this was missing something . the chicken did turn out nice and moist with a pleasant lemon taste but if i we re to make this again i 'd definitely add minced garlic and perhaps marinate the chicken ahead of time so that it picks up a bit more flavor .	1

Thankfully I'm not the first one to prepare or rate this recipe. I took advice from several different reviews and here is my variation: Spray the baking dish with cooking spray substitute half the butter with EVOO increase the honey to 3 Tbsp add 1/2 tsp each of ginger and garlic powder to the other sauce ingredients. Bake as described my chicken pieces were large and took a full hour to cook. When the chicken is finished baking remove from baking dish put chicken aside to rest with a rubber scraper transfer the sauce and drippings into a sauce pan. Whisk 1 tsp of corn starch into 3 oz of cold white wine. Mix this into the sauce and drippings and heat until sauce thickens. Serve the thickened sauce over the chicken or as a dipping sauce. Mmmm mmmm mmmm! The side dishes served were buttered carrots and Jasmine white rice.

Followed recipe exactly. The breasts were thick so it took closer to an hour to fully cook but these were moist and delicious! I'm wondering if they were marinated in the sauce for several hours if it would be even better. I'm saving the leftover drippings to add to a soup later this winter. Update Making this for the 3rd or 4th time in a month. My son specifically asked for this meal.

I made the recipe exactly as written. The sauce was good but runny. It looked very unimpressive when I took it out of the oven. It was tasty but here are a few suggestions... I was steaming broccoli to have on the side & decided to add it to the casserole dish after it was out of the oven. The broccoli soaked up the sauce & was good. I served it with rice. I topped it with some fresh cracked pepper some parsley & added some crushed peanuts. Turned a blah looking dish into a totally impressive one. My husband loved it. I may try one other reviewers stove top method next time.	i made the recipe exactly as written . the sauce was good but runny . it looked very unimpressive when i took it out of the oven . it was tasty but here are a few suggestions ... i was steaming broccoli t o have on the side & decided to add it to the casserole dish after it was out of the oven . the broccoli soaked up the sauce & was good . i served it with rice . i topped it with some fresh cracked peppe r some parsley & added some crushed peanuts . turned a blah looking dish into a totally impressive one . my husband loved it . i may try one other reviewers stove top method next time .	1

WOW! I just made this for dinner tonight and my bf and I LOVED it!  This was SOOO easy to make.  The most time consuming part is slicing the onion / removing fat from the chicken (although I really didn't need to do the latter...). Use the best quality balsamic you can find - and afford (it REALLY does make a difference). Next time, I'll use a better quality balsamic (the dish was a tad tangy, but I like tart, so it wasn't an issue for me),  mix the balsamic, tomatoes & spices together BEFORE adding to the skillet (the spices tend to clump together otherwise) and add fresh minced garlic to the skillet as the breasts simmer (in lieu of the garlic salt called for).  If you are in a hurry or don't have all of the spices on hand, substitute Italian seasoned tomatoes for the plain ones and omit the seasonings alltogether.  This dish goes particularly well with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans, although, I think I'll try it with seasoned rice (i.e. chicken flavor) & steamed asparagus or broccoli next time to change things up a bit.	wow ! i just made this for dinner tonight and my bf and i loved it ! this was sooo easy to make . the most time consuming part is slicing the onion / removing fat from the chicken -lrb- although i really di d n't need to do the latter ... -rrb- . use the best quality balsamic you can find - and afford -lrb- it really does make a difference -rrb- . next time , i 'll use a better quality balsamic -lrb- the dish was a tad tangy , but i like tart , so it was n't an issue for me -rrb- , mix the balsamic , tomatoes & spices together before adding to the skillet -lrb- the spices tend to clump together otherwise -rrb- and add fresh minced garlic to the skillet as the breasts simmer -lrb- in lieu of the garlic salt called for -rrb- . if you are in a hurry or do n't have all of the spices on hand , substitute italian seasoned tomatoes for the plain ones and omit the seasonings alltogether . this dish goes particularly well with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans , although , i think i 'll try it with seasoned rice -lrb- i.e. chicken flavor -rrb- & steamed asparagus o r broccoli next time to change things up a bit .	1
Just a note to those who aren't fond of balsamic vinegar. Try adding some chicken stock in with the vinegar to equal the 1/2 cup measurement. It's a great way to cut down on the bite of the vinegarbut, still adds great flavor. So, those who might give up on this recipe try it this way and see what you think.	just a note to those who are n't fond of balsamic vinegar . try adding some chicken stock in with the vinegar to equal the 1/2 cup measurement . it 's a great way to cut down on the bite of the vinegarbut , still adds great flavor . so , those who might give up on this recipe try it this way and see what you think .	1
I made this in the crockpot. Very easy to make. I prepped everything the night before and the next morning just popped everything in the crockpot and turned on low the chicken was even frozen. I did use only 1/4 C. of balsamic vinegar as recommended in other reviews and I will add garlic cloves instead of garlic salt next time. Also I will use chicken on the bone instead of boneless/skinless chicken breast if I plan on making this in the crockpot. The boneless chicken turned out dry. Other than that the taste was very good.	i made this in the crockpot . very easy to make . i prepped everything the night before and the next morning just popped everything in the crockpot and turned on low the chicken was even frozen . i did u se only 1/4 c. of balsamic vinegar as recommended in other reviews and i will add garlic cloves instead of garlic salt next time . also i will use chicken on the bone instead of boneless/skinless chick en breast if i plan on making this in the crockpot . the boneless chicken turned out dry . other than that the taste was very good .	1
Loved this dish.... only made a few changes based on my family's preference: No onion and didn't miss it. Cut down the rosemary basil and oregano to 1/4 tsp each and omitted the thyme. Threw in sauteed mushrooms and roasted red peppers I had prepared for another meal. Now here's the secret use the very best balsamic vinegar you can find as it has the smoothest flavor and will cut down on the tart vinegar flavor and you must use San Marzano tomatoes. It makes all the difference.... Served this over angel hair pasta with a salad.

I made this for my beau last nite. Not sure if he would be a fan of the Balsamic flavor. I made it w/ 3 chicken breast and cut the balsamic amt in 1/2. I added mushrooms & topped off w/ some mozzarella cheese. I also added a touch of brown sugar to cut the tanginess of the vinegar and also to carmalize the onions & mushrooms. It was very tasty and I took the leftovers to work where they all wanted to recipe. I will definately make this again!	i made this for my beau last nite . not sure if he would be a fan of the balsamic flavor . i made it w / 3 chicken breast and cut the balsamic amt in 1/2 . i added mushrooms & topped off w / some mozzarell a cheese . i also added a touch of brown sugar to cut the tanginess of the vinegar and also to carmalize the onions & mushrooms . it was very tasty and i took the leftovers to work where they all wanted to recipe . i will definately make this again !	1
Suggestion: Do not make this as stated if you are not a fan of the balsamic taste. All others enjoy this delightful dish.

Due to previous reviews about it being too runny, I drained the tomatoes (I used diced tomatoes with onion, celery, and green peppers).  I omitted the pepper (my family doesn't like them), and added 4 or so cloves of sliced garlic (a must!).  I used Tony Chachere's seasoning, and only 1/2 tsp. cayenne and I thought it was perfect, but some (like my mother-in-law who is very sensitive), might find it a big spicy (nothing a little sour cream on top won't fix :D).  Finally, I planned on adding rice directly in the crock pot, but it turned out to actually be too dry (may be because it cooked for 9 1/2 hours), so I had to cook the rice separately, then stirred it in with about 1/2 cup of extra chicken broth.  So easy, and so good!	i thought this was fantastic ! i live in new orleans and believe the taste to be authentic . due to previous reviews about it being too runny , i drained the tomatoes -lrb- i used diced tomatoes with onion , celery , and green peppers -rrb- . i omitted the pepper -lrb- my family does n't like them -rrb- , and added 4 or so cloves of sliced garlic -lrb- a must ! -rrb- . i used tony chachere 's seasoning , and only 1/2 tsp . cayenne and i thought it was perfect , but some -lrb- like my mother-in-law who is very sensitive -rrb- , might find it a big spicy -lrb- nothing a little sour cream on top wo n't fix :d -rrb- . finally , i planned on adding rice direct ly in the crock pot , but it turned out to actually be too dry -lrb- may be because it cooked for 9 1/2 hours -rrb- , so i had to cook the rice separately , then stirred it in with about 1/2 cup of extra chicken b roth . so easy , and so good !	2
"I have never been a real jambalaya fan...but this is the BOMB!  I love the combination of chicken, sausage and shrimp.  The only things I do different... I don't like cooked celery, so I omit that...and I serve it over red beans a rice that I make from a package, instead of plain white rice.  Oh I also use uncooked shrimp and add it a little earlier to the crock pot...cooked shrimp tends to get too chewy.

YUM YUM YUM - always requested...and this year we're having a Cajun themed Christmas of which this dish will be the main meal."	i have never been a real jambalaya fan ... but this is the bomb ! i love the combination of chicken , sausage and shrimp . the only things i do different ... i do n't like cooked celery , so i omit that ... a nd i serve it over red beans a rice that i make from a package , instead of plain white rice . oh i also use uncooked shrimp and add it a little earlier to the crock pot ... cooked shrimp tends to get to o chewy . yum yum yum - always requested ... and this year we 're having a cajun themed christmas of which this dish will be the main meal .	1
My whole family loved this recipe. I would not cut down on the spices like some suggested. I don't like things too spicy and this had kick but was not too hot. I also would make the rice separate and pour the jambalaya over it. I tried adding the rice to the crock pot and it absorbed all of the liquid too quickly not allowing the rice to fully cook.	my whole family loved this recipe . i would not cut down on the spices like some suggested . i do n't like things too spicy and this had kick but was not too hot . i also would make the rice separate and pour the jambalaya over it . i tried adding the rice to the crock pot and it absorbed all of the liquid too quickly not allowing the rice to fully cook .	1
When I made this chili I used 3 cans of beans 2cups of frozen corn & 2cups of chicken broth instead of the water. The other thing different I did was let it cook in a crock pot on high for about 6 hrs. There was not even a drop left that football Sunday!

I only used one green and one red pepper black beans instead of kidney and crushed tomatoes instead of diced due to FC (finicky child) and she still didn't like this soup. My husband and I LOVED it; the FC knows nothing! I also substituted chicken broth for the water and added extra corn and will make it the same way next time.

I used a combination of red, orange and yellow organic peppers and I threw in a bunch of fresh minced garlic and three coarsely chopped zucchini in with the chopped veggies/chicken. Instead of kidney beans, I used organic black beans because that's what I had on hand. I used organic chicken broth instead of water to add a little more flavor and after tasting it, I added in onion powder, ground coriander, oregano, paprika, and a little Splenda brown sugar blend and threw in a bit more cumin and chili powder. This soup is very tasty. I highly recommend using all organic ingredients if you can and really adding the extra spices.	i used a combination of red , orange and yellow organic peppers and i threw in a bunch of fresh minced garlic and three coarsely chopped zucchini in with the chopped veggies/chicken . instead of kidney beans , i used organic black beans because that 's what i had on hand . i used organic chicken broth instead of water to add a little more flavor and after tasting it , i added in onion powder , ground cor iander , oregano , paprika , and a little splenda brown sugar blend and threw in a bit more cumin and chili powder . this soup is very tasty . i highly recommend using all organic ingredients if you can an d really adding the extra spices .	1

Quick to prepare and good tasting. My husband said it had the perfect blend of seasonings.

I was not at all impressed with this chili. To me it tasted like it was definitely missing something and I could not figure out what it was. This soup was watery and the chicken didn't soak up the flavor well at all. It was extremely bland. I eventually added some hot sauce oregano and cheese which seemed to help some. I won't be making this again.	i was not at all impressed with this chili . to me it tasted like it was definitely missing something and i could not figure out what it was . this soup was watery and the chicken did n't soak up the fla vor well at all . it was extremely bland . i eventually added some hot sauce oregano and cheese which seemed to help some . i wo n't be making this again .	1
I was looking for something different to do with my chicken breasts and this recipe was on the front page including a video on how to prepare. So easy and tasty and a big hit with the family! Didn't have to run to the grocery store because I had everything on hand. I lied - except for the chipotle seasoning! I did a web search and found I could use a paprika red pepper with a dash of chili powder as a substitute. About 1/2 tsp. paprika 1/8 red pepper and a dash of chili powder. Will look for chipotle seasoning for the next time I make this!	i was looking for something different to do with my chicken breasts and this recipe was on the front page including a video on how to prepare . so easy and tasty and a big hit with the family ! did n't h ave to run to the grocery store because i had everything on hand . i lied - except for the chipotle seasoning ! i did a web search and found i could use a paprika red pepper with a dash of chili powder as a substitute . about 1/2 tsp . paprika 1/8 red pepper and a dash of chili powder . will look for chipotle seasoning for the next time i make this !	1

I could not find chipotle chile powder so I used cajun seasoning. Put a bit on the chicken too. Gravy was so good. Watch the video if you are not a gravy expert and you will master it!!

As I have begun to learn to cook in order to reduce my monthly expenses while still eating well I found this recipe more than anything else really helped me grasp the process of cooking in a pan keeping the oil and gravy from evaporating etc. I think the author is correct about it being an excellent entry level recipe.

I love to make these! My mother was from Poland and she used sweet pickle instead...both have a great flavor. I also like the way you use the whole piece of meat and roll up. I would cut it up into 3 pieces and makes smaller rollups which is so much work. and I use toothpicks..my mother also made a saltine cracker stuffing (crushed crackers chopped onions 1 egg Kellogg's corn flake crumbs and milk) rollup along with the pickle ones.

Just made it for my family of five last night. I just started cooking but my father ( a very good trained chef in my opinion) said it was restaurant quality. I TRIPLED the recipe and there was not one bit of leftovers. However I used sharp cheddar rather than Gruyere (a Vermonters spin on it) and instead of doing individual sandwiches I hollowed out a big loaf of artisan bread and stuffed it with the cheese sauce. We cut it into sections and had it with a side of steamed broccoli in a sharp cheddar cheese sauce. Absolutely amazing. I will definitely make this dish a regular one. It's affordable it's quick and it's delicious.	just made it for my family of five last night . i just started cooking but my father -lrb- a very good trained chef in my opinion -rrb- said it was restaurant quality . i tripled the recipe and there was not one bit of leftovers . however i used sharp cheddar rather than gruyere -lrb- a vermonters spin on it -rrb- and instead of doing individual sandwiches i hollowed out a big loaf of artisan bread and stuffed it with the cheese sauce . we cut it into sections and had it with a side of steamed broccoli in a sharp cheddar cheese sauce . absolutely amazing . i will definitely make this dish a regular one . it 's affordabl e it 's quick and it 's delicious .	1
I made this just as directed by Chef John and everyone loved them. They made the perfect lunch for us as we greeted out-of-town visitors. I did think that they were just a tad on the bland side a fact that could be that I used some Honeybaked ham rather than the smoked ham called for. I am surprised that Chef didn't add a little cayenne to this since that is present in so many of his recipes!:) I would definitely recommend this sandwich!	i made this just as directed by chef john and everyone loved them . they made the perfect lunch for us as we greeted out-of-town visitors . i did think that they were just a tad on the bland side a fact that could be that i used some honeybaked ham rather than the smoked ham called for . i am surprised that chef did n't add a little cayenne to this since that is present in so many of his recipes ! :-rrb- i would definitely recommend this sandwich !	1

This recipe was simple and easy to make. I really liked the idea of it. I don't understand the inclusion of the pickles - they didn't add anything as far as I could tell but were just odd when you bit into them. And the texture was oddly creamy which I found to be off putting. Overall not my favorite but wasn't terrible.	this recipe was simple and easy to make . i really liked the idea of it . i do n't understand the inclusion of the pickles - they did n't add anything as far as i could tell but were just odd when you bit into them . and the texture was oddly creamy which i found to be off putting . overall not my favorite but was n't terrible .	1
"This recipe is straight forward and the final product is very impressive. I added a bit more flour to make the sauce thicker because I wanted it to be more like gravy.

Extremely good except for the fact that I had to thicken my sauce much longer than anticipated. The amount of chicken stock to add should be halved as should the parsley amount.

Wow! This was great and super easy! I did make a few changes but nothing drastic. I omitted the milk and added some chopped parsley in with the egg so the parsley was actually on the chicken. I used dry white wine instead of the sherry and chicken broth instead of veggie. I don't think the changes I made would make huge taste differences so yes this is another 5 star recipe for sure!

Such a nice change from other grilled chicken and so healthy.  You can do this marinade with any type of chicken (ie: boneless, skinless breasts or thighs).  I didn't even marinate it for more than 1 1/2 hours and it was still delicious! The yogurt harissa (hot sauce) mixture is great with the chicken.

Outstanding. Greeks and Indians famous for using natural live yogurt for moisture and tenderization. Good flavors though I'd add onion.

Since I'm a vegetarian, I substituted firm tofu for the chicken. I cooked the tofu per instructions but didn't add it back to the pot with the stock until almost ready for serving.  Also, I used coconut milk and cut the stock down by 12 oz.  Didn't have zucchini; used fresh green beans instead as well as 1 cup pumpkin puree to firm it up.  Didn't have fresh peanuts or cilantro but it didn't matter.  Served the stew over cooked spaghetti squash.  It was filling and delicious.	since i 'm a vegetarian , i substituted firm tofu for the chicken . i cooked the tofu per instructions but did n't add it back to the pot with the stock until almost ready for serving . also , i used cocon ut milk and cut the stock down by 12 oz . did n't have zucchini ; used fresh green beans instead as well as 1 cup pumpkin puree to firm it up . did n't have fresh peanuts or cilantro but it did n't matter . served the stew over cooked spaghetti squash . it was filling and delicious .	1

As a huge fan of Chef John, I'm always willing to try a recipe he posts. This one, while certainly good, wasn't a big hit here. I was actually very surprised, (given the ingredients), that this wasn't more flavorful. Since it's from Chef John, I'll try making it again before deleting it from my favorites, but may make a few adjustments to spice things up.	as a huge fan of chef john , i 'm always willing to try a recipe he posts . this one , while certainly good , was n't a big hit here . i was actually very surprised , -lrb- given the ingredients -rrb- , that this was n't more flavorful . since it 's from chef john , i 'll try making it again before deleting it from my favorites , but may make a few adjustments to spice things up .	1

Yummy! Wonderful smell and taste. Love it! Recipe made a lot so enjoyed leftovers the next day. Be sure to prep all ingredients before starting because I did not and spent too much time running around the kitchen looking for tools with which to cut and chop. Lesson learned lol:) Served with Basmati rice and salad.	yummy ! wonderful smell and taste . love it ! recipe made a lot so enjoyed leftovers the next day . be sure to prep all ingredients before starting because i did not and spent too much time running around the kitchen looking for tools with which to cut and chop . lesson learned lol :-rrb- served with basmati rice and salad .	1
I have it simmering on my stove now and it is the best sauce I've ever made and I'm an old Italian fuss. I added the ingredients Chef John puts in his Tomato Sauce recipe also on this site i.e. 1 rib celery 2 tea sugar 1 tea anchovy paste 1 tea white wine vinegar and 1/2 tea dried Italian herbs. It is so heavenly and old fashion tasting it almost brings tears to my eyes.	i have it simmering on my stove now and it is the best sauce i 've ever made and i 'm an old italian fuss . i added the ingredients chef john puts in his tomato sauce recipe also on this site i.e. 1 rib celery 2 tea sugar 1 tea anchovy paste 1 tea white wine vinegar and 1/2 tea dried italian herbs . it is so heavenly and old fashion tasting it almost brings tears to my eyes .	1
So this is how my mother in law taught me to make sauce. We brown the meat bones in the pot we cook the sauce in rather than in the oven. The brown bits are already there. The meatballs we do cook on a cookie sheet in the oven We also add a little vino. Red or white works. We eat it that day and freeze the leftovers in single meal containers or freezer bags.	so this is how my mother in law taught me to make sauce . we brown the meat bones in the pot we cook the sauce in rather than in the oven . the brown bits are already there . the meatballs we do cook on a cookie sheet in the oven we also add a little vino . red or white works . we eat it that day and freeze the leftovers in single meal containers or freezer bags .	1

This looks just like the sauce my grandmother and aunts used to make. I've gotten away from putting meat in my sauce and really hate ground meat in sauce. Think I'll go back to this method. From my memories this is awesome. When Grandma made polenta the sauce she used was like this only she used Italian sausage simmered in the sauce - it was outstanding. Thanks Chef John for the walk down memory lane and for a keeper.	this looks just like the sauce my grandmother and aunts used to make . i 've gotten away from putting meat in my sauce and really hate ground meat in sauce . think i 'll go back to this method . from my me mories this is awesome . when grandma made polenta the sauce she used was like this only she used italian sausage simmered in the sauce - it was outstanding . thanks chef john for the walk down memory l ane and for a keeper .	1
There are many variations of this. We went to my grandmother's every Sunday for her version. Chef John's looks excellent as usual. My grandmother canned her own tomatoes from Italy once or twice a year in her basement kitchen. The whole family got together to help. Memories. Today I use San Marzano tomatoes.	there are many variations of this . we went to my grandmother 's every sunday for her version . chef john 's looks excellent as usual . my grandmother canned her own tomatoes from italy once or twice a yea r in her basement kitchen . the whole family got together to help . memories . today i use san marzano tomatoes .	1
I've made this 8 times now. The first 7 times, I skipped the Parmesan, thinking it would not make that much of a difference. Boy, was I wrong! Last night I added the Parmesan, and it took this dish from good to excellent. Don't skip the Parmesan! I  also use butter instead of olive oil; it gives the dish a richer taste. This is a wonderful recipe for everyday or company, and the best part is you always have the ingredients on hand.	i 've made this 8 times now . the first 7 times , i skipped the parmesan , thinking it would not make that much of a difference . boy , was i wrong ! last night i added the parmesan , and it took this dish fr om good to excellent . do n't skip the parmesan ! i also use butter instead of olive oil ; it gives the dish a richer taste . this is a wonderful recipe for everyday or company , and the best part is you a lways have the ingredients on hand .	1
We've made basically the same recipe for years using low or no-fat italian dressing instead of the olive oil.  Just as tasty and a LOT less fat.  No real recipe required - just dip chicken in dressing then dredge in a mixture of equal parts crumbs and parmesan, seasoned with additional garlic and herbs if you'd like.  To me, this was just much too greasy.	we 've made basically the same recipe for years using low or no-fat italian dressing instead of the olive oil . just as tasty and a lot less fat . no real recipe required - just dip chicken in dressing then dredge in a mixture of equal parts crumbs and parmesan , seasoned with additional garlic and herbs if you 'd like . to me , this was just much too greasy .	1
pounded the chicken breasts so they would be more tender, also added lots more garlic, used italian seasoned bread crumbs, and needed almost two times the amount of crumbs anc cheese asked for. overall, very delicious.	pounded the chicken breasts so they would be more tender , also added lots more garlic , used italian seasoned bread crumbs , and needed almost two times the amount of crumbs anc cheese asked for . overal l , very delicious .	1
Husband and I both really enjoyed this. I modified recipe for 2 servings used an 8-ounce b/s chicken breast the same amount of asparagus and substituted jarred roasted red pepper for the bell pepper. Fast super-easy and perfect for my Weight Watchers plan...only 9 points! And anytime husband says 'I like it ' it's a keeper!

Im only giving it 3 stars because it was bland for my taste but has lots of potential. The second time I made it I changed a few things. I sauteed a small chopped onion dash of red pepper flakes and 2 minced garlic cloves until translucent. Then added the chicken salt pepper a dash or two of dried oregano and basil. This really upped the flavor without adding a ton of calories and turned it into a 5 star dish. Yum yum.

Been trying to cook more with quinoa since it's really quite an incredible grain. Aside from simply substituting it for rice I am always on the prowl for easy dinners that use it. This recipe looked like just the ticket for a quick mid-week dinner except it did look a little bland and my husband is not keen on asparagus. I had a bag of frozen spring vegetables with a cracked peppercorn seasoning (PictSweet Steamables) so I substituted that for the asparagus there was red pepper in it as well as a small amount of asparagus and some zucchini and green beans. So it seemed on par. Looking at other reviews I also added some minced garlic chopped onion and some Penzey's Tuscan Sunset spice blend (it's an Italian Style seasoning.) My husband walked in the door as I was cooking and exclaimed that the house smelled FANTASTIC. Another reviewer had mentioned that the meal was only 9 Weight Watcher points. He's on WW so when I told him that he was even happier. This easy to prepare meal with ingredients I usually have on hand will definitely be in the regular rotation!	been trying to cook more with quinoa since it 's really quite an incredible grain . aside from simply substituting it for rice i am always on the prowl for easy dinners that use it . this recipe looked l ike just the ticket for a quick mid-week dinner except it did look a little bland and my husband is not keen on asparagus . i had a bag of frozen spring vegetables with a cracked peppercorn seasoning -lrb- pictsweet steamables -rrb- so i substituted that for the asparagus there was red pepper in it as well as a small amount of asparagus and some zucchini and green beans . so it seemed on par . looking at other reviews i also added some minced garlic chopped onion and some penzey 's tuscan sunset spice blend -lrb- it 's an italian style seasoning . -rrb- my husband walked in the door as i was cooking and exclaimed that the house smelled fantastic . another reviewer had mentioned that the meal was only 9 weight watcher points . he 's on ww so when i told him that he was even happier . this easy to prepare meal with ingre dients i usually have on hand will definitely be in the regular rotation !	1

I was looking for a recipe containing these ingredients and found a winner!! I read all the reviews to see the tweaks and changes. I combined most of them-sautéed onion garlic added a little basil and salt; used the leftover chicken broth to poach my chicken breasts and cooked the quinoa in that. Finally I sprinkled some feta cheese on top and it was so yummy!! Definitely will make this again and share the recipe with friends and family that want to eat healthy!	i was looking for a recipe containing these ingredients and found a winner !! i read all the reviews to see the tweaks and changes . i combined most of them-sautéed onion garlic added a little basil and salt ; used the leftover chicken broth to poach my chicken breasts and cooked the quinoa in that . finally i sprinkled some feta cheese on top and it was so yummy !! definitely will make this again and share the recipe with friends and family that want to eat healthy !	1

My family has always loved roast chicken so I have made it for years. This recipe is the best I have ever made. The chicken was very juicy and so tender. I even made the sauce and could not believe how good it was and how incredibly simple it was to make. I was out of lemons so I substituted white wine vinegar and it was terrific!

I made this with an organic whole chicken and my picky family raved over it! Juicy crispy crust and not a salty taste.

We really enjoyed this chicken! I love making whole chickens and do so at least twice a month. This recipe was a nice change up from my usual rosemary and garlic roasted bird. It did turn out rather salty and I used coarse ground kosher salt - but it wasn't inedible salty. (and of course I expected it to be salty!) I prepared this in my infrared oven which I believe helped the skin to crisp very nicely. The whole thing was a beautiful uniform golden color. My husband teenage daughter and I loved the sauce but my young children didn't care for the lemon flavor of it so next time I will try making it with white wine in place of the lemon juice. This recipe is a keeper that I will make again and again.	we really enjoyed this chicken ! i love making whole chickens and do so at least twice a month . this recipe was a nice change up from my usual rosemary and garlic roasted bird . it did turn out rather s alty and i used coarse ground kosher salt - but it was n't inedible salty . -lrb- and of course i expected it to be salty ! -rrb- i prepared this in my infrared oven which i believe helped the skin to crisp very n icely . the whole thing was a beautiful uniform golden color . my husband teenage daughter and i loved the sauce but my young children did n't care for the lemon flavor of it so next time i will try maki ng it with white wine in place of the lemon juice . this recipe is a keeper that i will make again and again .	1

well I really mucked this recipe...I used sea salt instead of Kosher--didn't think it would make that much of a difference but it did. The chicken came out greasy and way to salty tasting and the jus is inedible. Sorry Chef-will try again using kosher next time! I don't think it is proper to give this recipe a rating until I follow it exactly so I will give it a 3 for now.	well i really mucked this recipe ... i used sea salt instead of kosher -- did n't think it would make that much of a difference but it did . the chicken came out greasy and way to salty tasting and the jus is inedible . sorry chef-will try again using kosher next time ! i do n't think it is proper to give this recipe a rating until i follow it exactly so i will give it a 3 for now .	1

These burgers were delicious. Make the peanut sauce just before serving as a chemical reaction occurs and the spread got very thick and was quite difficult to spread but still tasted great.

These burgers are a delicious healthier version of comfort food. I used 1/2 ground chicken and 1/2 ground turkey to decrease the cost. I also added an egg to bind the meat mixture. I needed a side dish so I searched allrecipes and found Asian Cucumber and Peanut Salad (submitted by tammyn316).

I'm sorry but this sauce basically tastes like milk and cilantro no melding of the flavors what so ever. It aches for spices and seasonings namely salt. Plus the cream never thickens up because the juices from the chicken keep it thinned out so the consistency was disappointing. I rinsed the thin sauce off the chicken and shredded it.	i 'm sorry but this sauce basically tastes like milk and cilantro no melding of the flavors what so ever . it aches for spices and seasonings namely salt . plus the cream never thickens up because the ju ices from the chicken keep it thinned out so the consistency was disappointing . i rinsed the thin sauce off the chicken and shredded it .	1

I'd never baked chicken in cream before but found it a little odd because the fat separated from the water and formed 2 layers in the baking dish.

I made this as a dinner to take to my fiancée at work. I was a little worried about the crusty bread crumb top getting soggy in transport since I had to cover it but that didn t turn out to be a problem at all. The bread crumbs stayed nice and crisp and had all of that awesome flavor packed in. The only problem I ran into was that the chicken turned out to be a little tough but I think that was more of a problem with the quality of the chicken breast more so than the person preparing it. Why take responsibility when you really don t have to? I think next time I ll pound the chicken down a bit and hopefully that ll tenderize the meat a little. Overall it got rave reviews and my fiancée is still committed to me so I suppose this recipe was a win.	i made this as a dinner to take to my fiancée at work . i was a little worried about the crusty bread crumb top getting soggy in transport since i had to cover it but that didn t turn out to be a probl em at all . the bread crumbs stayed nice and crisp and had all of that awesome flavor packed in . the only problem i ran into was that the chicken turned out to be a little tough but i think that was mo re of a problem with the quality of the chicken breast more so than the person preparing it . why take responsibility when you really don t have to ? i think next time i ll pound the chicken down a bit and hopefully that ll tenderize the meat a little . overall it got rave reviews and my fiancée is still committed to me so i suppose this recipe was a win .	1

This was delicious! I followed the recipe as written except for doubling it to serve 4 people and adding garlic powder to the seasoning for the chicken. The breadcrumbs are really the star of this dish because they taste great (the cheese gives them a lot of flavor) and they add wonderful texture. I forgot to double the sauce recipe so there was only a little bit for each cutlet but it was still quite tasty and I'm sure it would be even better with the full amount.

This recipe was very good! I will be making it again spouse loved it. The only thing I would do differently is maybe not so much garlic. Now garlic cloves as we all know come in all different sizes. I probably chose too large of cloves.

I would cut the l mon joyce down and add a bit more chicken broth in its lace as it was a bit too tangy.	absolutely delicious . the chicken was very juicy ! hard to believe it was from boneless skinless chicken breast . i would cut the l mon joyce down and add a bit more chicken broth in its lace as it was a bit too tangy .	1

This was not a difficult recipe. I did use boneless chicken and followed everything else. I worked fine. This is not the BEST fried chicken I have had, but it was tasty and nice and crispy. I did not need 2 cups of buttermilk, so just pour in as much as you need to cover the chicken good. The rest of the ingredients I used the same. I used about 2 inches of oil to fry in and let it get good and brown.	this was not a difficult recipe . i did use boneless chicken and followed everything else . i worked fine . this is not the best fried chicken i have had , but it was tasty and nice and crispy . i did not need 2 cups of buttermilk , so just pour in as much as you need to cover the chicken good . the rest of the ingredients i used the same . i used about 2 inches of oil to fry in and let it get good and br own .	1
This is absolutely the best fried chicken recipe ever! The outside is crispy & the meat is moist & tender. I made it exactly as directed except used boneless skinless breasts cut into thirds.

I like this recipe when I saw the video. However when I saw the nutritional information I groaned. Of course I knew fried chicken was high fat but seeing it print detered me from making it. I decided to use the ingredients and make oven fried chicken. I use all the ingredients except the oil. After coating the chicken with the seasoned flour I sprayed it with PAM. I used a non stick baking pan. The results were wonderful!!	i like this recipe when i saw the video . however when i saw the nutritional information i groaned . of course i knew fried chicken was high fat but seeing it print detered me from making it . i decided to use the ingredients and make oven fried chicken . i use all the ingredients except the oil . after coating the chicken with the seasoned flour i sprayed it with pam . i used a non stick baking pan . th e results were wonderful !!	1

For the most part I followed the recipe, the only thing I did different was I cooked the corned beef brisket in the slow cooker for a day and a half, but that was more for my benefit. I love the smell in my house and also it made chopping it easier, it just falls apart. I have never cooked corned beef so I never dreamed I could make corned beef hash. The recipe is simple and tasty! Huge success. And it freezes well, this makes a lot for two people to eat so we froze most of it. We just take it out and put it in the fridge the night before then pop it in the microwave. Yumm!

The flavor is out of this world good and I used baby red potatoes because I like to leave them unpeeled. The fire roasted salsa adds a delicious but subtle Southwestern flavor and instead of poached egg I topped the hash with more salsa and some sour cream. I had trouble flipping the hash in pieces so I did the best I could and just cooked it until it was crisp in pieces. Delicious!!	the flavor is out of this world good and i used baby red potatoes because i like to leave them unpeeled . the fire roasted salsa adds a delicious but subtle southwestern flavor and instead of poached e gg i topped the hash with more salsa and some sour cream . i had trouble flipping the hash in pieces so i did the best i could and just cooked it until it was crisp in pieces . delicious !!	1

Very Good! I had some left over roast beef that I needed to use up and went looking for a hash recipe.  My mom made it for us many years ago to use up roast beef (and probably lamb or other roasts) and I recall her grinding the cooked meat but I just chopped it up.  I used olive oil and regular onion as that was what I had.  I didn't have the proper salsa but served it with ketchup like my mom did.  Delish!!  It brought back good memories, too. Thank you for the recipe.  Next time I'll try it with the salsa.	very good ! i had some left over roast beef that i needed to use up and went looking for a hash recipe . my mom made it for us many years ago to use up roast beef -lrb- and probably lamb or other roasts -rrb- an d i recall her grinding the cooked meat but i just chopped it up . i used olive oil and regular onion as that was what i had . i did n't have the proper salsa but served it with ketchup like my mom did . delish !! it brought back good memories , too . thank you for the recipe . next time i 'll try it with the salsa .	1

I Wondered. What the heck is the big deal about corned beef hash? Well now I know. Chopped up the leftover corned beef potatoes carrots and onions from the crockpot corned beef dinner. Added everything in recipe except green onions. Didn't have them. The salsa gives it spice but you can't tell it's from salsa. Perfect. Had it for breakfast next morning with sunny side up eggs on top.

Really tasty ate along side some caprese salad and some garlic bread and it was delicious. However the gnocchi took FOREVER to cook. Much longer than it said in the video and on the recipe. We think it was because we did not drain the ricotta because we just bought some cheap not fancy-basket ricotta but did not read the note about having to drain it. So if you do not buy basket ricotta make sure you drain it otherwise the gnocchi will take forever!	really tasty ate along side some caprese salad and some garlic bread and it was delicious . however the gnocchi took forever to cook . much longer than it said in the video and on the recipe . we think i t was because we did not drain the ricotta because we just bought some cheap not fancy-basket ricotta but did not read the note about having to drain it . so if you do not buy basket ricotta make sure you drain it otherwise the gnocchi will take forever !	1
I had gnocchi at a restaurant once that changed my life. I never imagined I'd find a comparable recipe! I doubt I will ever buy store gnocchi again. This is so much softer and delicious! I will definitely look harder next time for the dry ricotta.

Who knew gnocchi was this simple to make... The basil was so aromatic but like someone else said it turned brown in the blender even after blanching in warm water. No way did it look as green as chef John's. Made the ricotta from the epicurious recipe. I rolled the dough into rolls and cut it to save time rather than scooping one by one into the pan. These were super easy quick (if you make the ricotta ahead of time or buy it) and tasty. Will be making this again and again - thank you for a fool-proof recipe!	who knew gnocchi was this simple to make ... the basil was so aromatic but like someone else said it turned brown in the blender even after blanching in warm water . no way did it look as green as chef john 's . made the ricotta from the epicurious recipe . i rolled the dough into rolls and cut it to save time rather than scooping one by one into the pan . these were super easy quick -lrb- if you make the ri cotta ahead of time or buy it -rrb- and tasty . will be making this again and again - thank you for a fool-proof recipe !	1

This was the wettest recipe for gnocchi that I thought it was labeled in error and was supposed to be a spaetzle. I dusted the dough generously with flour in order to cut and shape them and then it was still a challenge.

A wonderful easy standard in our rotation of meals. Don't change the ingredients but I do have a few tips for easy prep: I double this and put the chicken sun-dried tomatoes and SDT oil and all remaining ingredients (except parm and noodles) into 2 large zip lock bags. I throw 1 bag in the fridge until I'm ready to cook it in the evening and the other bag goes into the freezer. When I go to make this meal again in the future I pull out the frozen bag and thaw it which also marinates the meat a the same time. I heat a pan dump it in and it's done even before the noodles!!	a wonderful easy standard in our rotation of meals . do n't change the ingredients but i do have a few tips for easy prep : i double this and put the chicken sun-dried tomatoes and sdt oil and all remain ing ingredients -lrb- except parm and noodles -rrb- into 2 large zip lock bags . i throw 1 bag in the fridge until i 'm ready to cook it in the evening and the other bag goes into the freezer . when i go to make t his meal again in the future i pull out the frozen bag and thaw it which also marinates the meat a the same time . i heat a pan dump it in and it 's done even before the noodles !!	1
Very tasty and quick recipe. I put the chicken oil from the sun-dried tomatoes and herbs into a large zip lock bag a marinated it in the refrigerator for an hour before cooking. I also added some red pepper flakes to spice it up. I made the Garden Herb Loaf from this site to serve with it. Between the colorful pasta and the pretty herb bread that was a quick braided loaf it was a beautiful presentation. Thanks Cindy.	very tasty and quick recipe . i put the chicken oil from the sun-dried tomatoes and herbs into a large zip lock bag a marinated it in the refrigerator for an hour before cooking . i also added some red pepper flakes to spice it up . i made the garden herb loaf from this site to serve with it . between the colorful pasta and the pretty herb bread that was a quick braided loaf it was a beautiful present ation . thanks cindy .	1

I give this recipe four stars only because I didn't follow it exactly. I hate sun dried tomatoes so instead I cooked some fresh chopped spinach. Also I only had a bag of frozen chicken breasts and no time to thaw so I baked the chicken with some Italian salad dressing drizzled over the tops. Other than that I followed everything in the recipe. It was delicious!!!!! First time I've ever had pasta that wasn't slathered in some sort of sauce! Definitely will be making this again.	i give this recipe four stars only because i did n't follow it exactly . i hate sun dried tomatoes so instead i cooked some fresh chopped spinach . also i only had a bag of frozen chicken breasts and no time to thaw so i baked the chicken with some italian salad dressing drizzled over the tops . other than that i followed everything in the recipe . it was delicious !!!!! first time i 've ever had pasta t hat was n't slathered in some sort of sauce ! definitely will be making this again .	1
Very good! I made it with penne pasta since this is all I had. I did not have sun dried tomatoes so I did what another reviewer did and added some spinach and also some grape tomatoes halved. I had some Italian spice mixes that I used in there instead of the oregano and basil. A little dry after it was mixed so I added a drizzle of evoo.

The first time I made this it wasn't horrible it's just the second time around it was so much better. This recipe is excellent after you alter slightly. On it's own the pepper can be a little dominant as far as taste and bok choy doesn't seem necessary. My suggestion is use more soy and oyster sauce cut out the pepper and leave the bok choy optional. After that it was sensational. Adding a little more sugar and a chicken bouillon cube to the water doesn't hurt either.	the first time i made this it was n't horrible it 's just the second time around it was so much better . this recipe is excellent after you alter slightly . on it 's own the pepper can be a little dominant as far as taste and bok choy does n't seem necessary . my suggestion is use more soy and oyster sauce cut out the pepper and leave the bok choy optional . after that it was sensational . adding a little more sugar and a chicken bouillon cube to the water does n't hurt either .	1

I'm not sure why since all the right ingredients seemed to be here but this was really kind of boring. I would have thought the oyster sauce soy sauce and garlic all would have contributed great flavor but it all just sort of got lost. Perhaps some sherry toasted sesame oil and chicken broth would have helped. I did back off the pepper which seemed excessive because as the saying goes you can always add more but you can't take it away. I also steered away from the cooking method as directed. Since some of the ingredients require different cooking times I cooked them separately then combined it all at the end. I added mushrooms and served this over rice noodles which was a nice combo but unfortunately tonight's dinner was rather forgettable.	i 'm not sure why since all the right ingredients seemed to be here but this was really kind of boring . i would have thought the oyster sauce soy sauce and garlic all would have contributed great flavo r but it all just sort of got lost . perhaps some sherry toasted sesame oil and chicken broth would have helped . i did back off the pepper which seemed excessive because as the saying goes you can alwa ys add more but you ca n't take it away . i also steered away from the cooking method as directed . since some of the ingredients require different cooking times i cooked them separately then combined it all at the end . i added mushrooms and served this over rice noodles which was a nice combo but unfortunately tonight 's dinner was rather forgettable .	1
Awesome! I marinaded the chicken in oyster sauce soy sauce and garlic paste overnight. I added more during the cooking when I saw it wasn't going to be saucy enough. I didn't need to add any cornstarch as it thickened up quite nicely on its own. Finally I found that the bok choy needed very very little cooking - I stirred it in covered the pan for about 3 mins and it was tender crisp. Perfect! This would be great with carrots peppers bean sprouts mushrooms etc and I would be interested in making it again with a handful of chopped peanuts or cashews. Very versatile!

I used cilantro in place of oregano (didn't have any) and I added about 1 TBSP of Chili Powder.  It turned out great! We added the Chili Powder because the broth had an odd look to it with white chicken, white hominy, clear chicken broth and green chilis (kind of a green cast).  My son didn't like the look, so I added chili powder -- he loved it and asked me to make it again.	i used cilantro in place of oregano -lrb- did n't have any -rrb- and i added about 1 tbsp of chili powder . it turned out great ! we added the chili powder because the broth had an odd look to it with white chick en , white hominy , clear chicken broth and green chilis -lrb- kind of a green cast -rrb- . my son did n't like the look , so i added chili powder -- he loved it and asked me to make it again .	1

Great recipe. Quick and surprisingly good given the short cooking time. I was looking for a more traditional posole so I made a few changes: omitted the green chiles and olives added about 1/3 of a can of red enchilada sauce and topped with chopped cabbage and radishes.

I love this recipe. I tried it out and it was so tasty. I could eat this over and over again. I don't always use olives and tomatoes seems like it might be overkill but when cooking the chicken I use sesame seed oil rice wine vinegar and some soy sauce as well as a bit of powdered ginger for a boost of flavor for the chicken all by itself.

My Mom and Dad really liked this but I just thought it was OK. I kept thinking that it needed something like maybe some buffalo mozzeralla cut into cubes but both of my parents thought it was great as it was. We used 1 cup of chicken from a rotisserie chicken. I mixed the veggies with the dressing and put it in the fridge for an hour or so before we were ready to serve. I also cooked the pasta drained it and put it in the fridge an hour ahead of time. It helped to make the salad nicely chilled and helped to combine the flavors. I will probably make again for my hubby with the addition of the cheese.	my mom and dad really liked this but i just thought it was ok . i kept thinking that it needed something like maybe some buffalo mozzeralla cut into cubes but both of my parents thought it was great as it was . we used 1 cup of chicken from a rotisserie chicken . i mixed the veggies with the dressing and put it in the fridge for an hour or so before we were ready to serve . i also cooked the pasta dra ined it and put it in the fridge an hour ahead of time . it helped to make the salad nicely chilled and helped to combine the flavors . i will probably make again for my hubby with the addition of the c heese .	1

This salad is delicious! I served it to my husband and brother and they both loved it. I did change a little bit of it though.

Did this recipe twice. First time to me was 4-star. To make it 5-star for my family and I I ditched the cornmeal subbed buttermilk for the regular milk and doubled it and used a LOT more cayenne (bringing it closer to the recipe I've always used). Follow the actual process of preparing the tomatoes and cooking them. These steps are very important and Chef John has laid them out very well. When finished I used my own remoulade recipe (relish mayo lemon juice hot sauce cayenne paprika s&p blended smooth) and stacked my tomatoes with crab cakes with the remoulade (mixed with tiny salad shrimp) over all.

I have always wanted to try fried greens since the movie came out and finally with the help of Chef John hilarious video I took the leap. I was not expecting much just a novelty food and I was pleasantly surprised--these things are pretty good. Will have to work on my southern drawl next. Another home run--thanks Chef John	i have always wanted to try fried greens since the movie came out and finally with the help of chef john hilarious video i took the leap . i was not expecting much just a novelty food and i was pleasan tly surprised -- these things are pretty good . will have to work on my southern drawl next . another home run -- thanks chef john	1
This recipe is excellent! I usually shy away from any vegetable but so very happy I tried these. This is the third time in a month!!! It is a wonderful way to use up those end of the season green tomatoes in the garden. Did not change anything in the recipe. Just make and enjoy!

These were so easy and delicious even for a novice like me! I would not change a thing! I followed the directions EXACTLY setting out the tomatoes to drain keeping them in the flour for a while pushing in the cornmeal and this is the first time the coating didn't come off something I was trying to fry!

This ranks up there with my all time favorite soups. First of all, double the recipe, it's too much trouble and too good to only get 4 servings out of this soup. To help you decide how much pepper to use, use the full amount of ancho chili pepper.  Ancho chili pepper only adds depth of flavor not heat.  I did cut in half the chipotle chili pepper (that is where the heat is.  I used the full amount of cayenne.  I added a diced red pepper as I sautéed the onion. When you add the beans also add 2 cups of white frozen corn. For the garnish also use broken lime tortilla chips.  I promise, doing it this way will not be too spicy hot but just wonderful.	this ranks up there with my all time favorite soups . first of all , double the recipe , it 's too much trouble and too good to only get 4 servings out of this soup . to help you decide how much pepper to use , use the full amount of ancho chili pepper . ancho chili pepper only adds depth of flavor not heat . i did cut in half the chipotle chili pepper -lrb- that is where the heat is . i used the full amount of cayenne . i added a diced red pepper as i sautéed the onion . when you add the beans also add 2 cups of white frozen corn . for the garnish also use broken lime tortilla chips . i promise , doing it this way will not be too spicy hot but just wonderful .	2

This was a win!!!

Extremely Spicy- too overwhelming with the different chili powders. I only used one TEASPOON of the ancho chile powder not one tablespoon as the recipe calls for. I am glad I listened to my common sense. I usually like spicy food but wish I had reduced the peppers even more. If you want to try this recipe start with 1/4 the amount of ground peppers it calls for and then add more if you like. I wonder if all the rave reviews came from people who do not have these particular spices in their cabinet so they substituted a milder chili powder.	extremely spicy - too overwhelming with the different chili powders . i only used one teaspoon of the ancho chile powder not one tablespoon as the recipe calls for . i am glad i listened to my common sen se . i usually like spicy food but wish i had reduced the peppers even more . if you want to try this recipe start with 1/4 the amount of ground peppers it calls for and then add more if you like . i won der if all the rave reviews came from people who do not have these particular spices in their cabinet so they substituted a milder chili powder .	1
I made this tonight when the boyfriend came home sick. Spicy food always makes him feel better and man was this spicy. I made a few changes--I didn't have chipotle or ancho chile powder on hand so I used a generic chili powder blend and threw a couple adobo chipotle peppers in with the spices deseeded and chopped. I added a little cinnamon and just a dash of cloves because I think they play with the other flavors well and add a hint of complexity. This is a keeper. It's quick it's cheap it's delicious and if you have a 3 quart skillet it only uses one pan. A perfect dinner to spice up the middle of the week. No pun intended honestly.	i made this tonight when the boyfriend came home sick . spicy food always makes him feel better and man was this spicy . i made a few changes -- i did n't have chipotle or ancho chile powder on hand so i u sed a generic chili powder blend and threw a couple adobo chipotle peppers in with the spices deseeded and chopped . i added a little cinnamon and just a dash of cloves because i think they play with t he other flavors well and add a hint of complexity . this is a keeper . it 's quick it 's cheap it 's delicious and if you have a 3 quart skillet it only uses one pan . a perfect dinner to spice up the midd le of the week . no pun intended honestly .	1
I used this recipe as a basis for a white bean chicken chili cook off. I won! Of course I changed a few basic steps to suit my personal taste & spice it up a bit. I used a Costco rotisserie chicken as it has SO much flavor. Then used several packets of the new Campbell's Chicken & quinoa soup as well as chicken broth. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. Oops A little more cayenne pepper! Lots of cilantro for garnish. It was fabulous! Everyone loved it. It took a long time to make but was worth it. Try it! You'll be glad you did! I won 1st place out of 12 entries.

I ll admit that I m a baby when it comes to spicy food but my husband enjoys a good fiery dish from time to time. When I cook I try to reach a happy medium that will satisfy both of us. I was nervous about the amount of chili powder in this recipe so I started with just half the amount. Turns out even that was way too much and hubby agreed. I trust his judgement when he says it s overkill. The saving grace for this recipe is the toppings. The sour cream cools it down and the fresh cilantro and green onions gives it much needed flavor. Suffice to say we did not skimp with the toppings!	i ll admit that i m a baby when it comes to spicy food but my husband enjoys a good fiery dish from time to time . when i cook i try to reach a happy medium that will satisfy both of us . i was nervous about the amount of chili powder in this recipe so i started with just half the amount . turns out even that was way too much and hubby agreed . i trust his judgement when he says it s overkill . the sav ing grace for this recipe is the toppings . the sour cream cools it down and the fresh cilantro and green onions gives it much needed flavor . suffice to say we did not skimp with the toppings !	1

These buns bake up to a beautiful color inside and out are soft and fluffy exquisite taste and were the perfect choice for some Asian Turkey Burgers. I did flatten each bun as I placed it on the baking sheet but next time I will flatten a bit more as they had more of a dome than I would have liked. Beautiful dough easy to work with and definitely worth the effort to make.	these buns bake up to a beautiful color inside and out are soft and fluffy exquisite taste and were the perfect choice for some asian turkey burgers . i did flatten each bun as i placed it on the bakin g sheet but next time i will flatten a bit more as they had more of a dome than i would have liked . beautiful dough easy to work with and definitely worth the effort to make .	1

Wow. I followed this recipe instructions exactly except for the fact that I had no idea where to find cloves and I don't personally like mushrooms. Yes it takes a while but you can reasonably break down tasks simultaneously. So that not much prep time is needed and much of your dishes and waste are already dealt with before the meal is prepared. This meal was incredible. It's better than most restaurants. I used a stock pot for the first step and a dutch oven for steps three through six. In hindsight I wish I had used chicken broth instead of water in step one. Even without I am telling you this stew is incredible. The combination of herbs is good. One set of herbs (tarragon rosemary herbes de Provence) reminds me a little of absinthe for some reason while the others added plenty of spiciness. I highly recommend this meal. It deserves WAY more reviews. It is spicy hot as some noted but not overly so. If one doesn't want it they could probably leave out the cayenne pepper. I think the cayenne pepper makes it perfect however.	wow . i followed this recipe instructions exactly except for the fact that i had no idea where to find cloves and i do n't personally like mushrooms . yes it takes a while but you can reasonably break do wn tasks simultaneously . so that not much prep time is needed and much of your dishes and waste are already dealt with before the meal is prepared . this meal was incredible . it 's better than most rest aurants . i used a stock pot for the first step and a dutch oven for steps three through six . in hindsight i wish i had used chicken broth instead of water in step one . even without i am telling you th is stew is incredible . the combination of herbs is good . one set of herbs -lrb- tarragon rosemary herbes de provence -rrb- reminds me a little of absinthe for some reason while the others added plenty of spicin ess . i highly recommend this meal . it deserves way more reviews . it is spicy hot as some noted but not overly so . if one does n't want it they could probably leave out the cayenne pepper . i think the c ayenne pepper makes it perfect however .	1

This was tasty but a bit too spicy. Next time I would not so much fresh taragon since it has a strong licorice flavor to it. I probably would opt for a spoon of it dry. I'd also cut all of the pepper in half and then add individual taste after it's served.	this was tasty but a bit too spicy . next time i would not so much fresh taragon since it has a strong licorice flavor to it . i probably would opt for a spoon of it dry . i 'd also cut all of the pepper in half and then add individual taste after it 's served .	1
WOW! I can't believe there aren't more written reviews. I didn't have all of the herbs called for but used what I had and the stew was amazing. I also didn't have mushrooms so I just added a few more carrots and celery (including the celery leaves because they always add great flavor). It is definitely worth the stove time.	wow ! i ca n't believe there are n't more written reviews . i did n't have all of the herbs called for but used what i had and the stew was amazing . i also did n't have mushrooms so i just added a few more carrots and celery -lrb- including the celery leaves because they always add great flavor -rrb- . it is definitely worth the stove time .	1
I gave this 3 stars because the basics are there for a good dish but it's not good as written. For starters there is way way too much pepper and it overpowers everything else. The last time I was around someone using this much pepper they were heavy smokers and their taste buds were zilched. Start out by reducing the pepper asked to 1/2 or 1/3 and increase or reduce it from there next time. If you try to rush the dish and not let it simmer to thicken then it will turn out very runny. I substitute frozen bisquits and they work out just fine and I like the flavor better than canned biscuits.	i gave this 3 stars because the basics are there for a good dish but it 's not good as written . for starters there is way way too much pepper and it overpowers everything else . the last time i was arou nd someone using this much pepper they were heavy smokers and their taste buds were zilched . start out by reducing the pepper asked to 1/2 or 1/3 and increase or reduce it from there next time . if you try to rush the dish and not let it simmer to thicken then it will turn out very runny . i substitute frozen bisquits and they work out just fine and i like the flavor better than canned biscuits .	1
I am just so happy I found and tried this recipe. It is flavourful and delicious. A warning to those about to make it it is a tad bit spicey. I am not one for spicey foods but I still loved this. Next time I will tone it down with the peppers. I think it is a must to use all the spices otherwise you will lose some of the flavor. I cannot wait to make this again. I should mention I don't own a dutch oven so those like me can use a stock pot and then throw it all in a roaster when it is time to place in the oven. Works just the same. Thanks Chef John for another great recipe!	i am just so happy i found and tried this recipe . it is flavourful and delicious . a warning to those about to make it it is a tad bit spicey . i am not one for spicey foods but i still loved this . next time i will tone it down with the peppers . i think it is a must to use all the spices otherwise you will lose some of the flavor . i can not wait to make this again . i should mention i do n't own a dutc h oven so those like me can use a stock pot and then throw it all in a roaster when it is time to place in the oven . works just the same . thanks chef john for another great recipe !	1
Comfort food times ten. I did a double take when I saw the ingredient amounts for the herbs and spices. After reading through other reviews I checked the amounts for this recipe on Chef John s website. They were the same. Made the decision to halve them and am glad I did. Was a terrific combination and still had plenty of punch. For the liquid used half homemade stock and half water. I think next time I ll add an additional piece of carrot and celery.	comfort food times ten . i did a double take when i saw the ingredient amounts for the herbs and spices . after reading through other reviews i checked the amounts for this recipe on chef john s website . they were the same . made the decision to halve them and am glad i did . was a terrific combination and still had plenty of punch . for the liquid used half homemade stock and half water . i think next time i ll add an additional piece of carrot and celery .	1
Excellent recipe!  We made it as written and would caution that it is very spicy.   If you're using the recipe in burritos as we did, it's perfect as the other ingredients mellow out the heat.  If I were making it for tacos or another recipe that it was more front and center, I would reduce the amount of peppers by 1 or 2.  All that being said, we made burritos with rice, beans and cheese and then topped each one with a bit of the sauce and some more cheese and tossed them under the broiler for a minute and it was truly amazing.  Served it with a side of shredded lettuce, tomato,  onions and fresh guacamole and garnished with fresh cilantro and cotija cheese . Far better than anything you can get at a restaurant.	excellent recipe ! we made it as written and would caution that it is very spicy . if you 're using the recipe in burritos as we did , it 's perfect as the other ingredients mellow out the heat . if i w ere making it for tacos or another recipe that it was more front and center , i would reduce the amount of peppers by 1 or 2 . all that being said , we made burritos with rice , beans and cheese and then topped each one with a bit of the sauce and some more cheese and tossed them under the broiler for a minute and it was truly amazing . served it with a side of shredded lettuce , tomato , onions and f resh guacamole and garnished with fresh cilantro and cotija cheese . far better than anything you can get at a restaurant .	1
I'm not a big fan of chipotle peppers - but this recipe made me change my mind about that!! I made enchiladas with them and no one could get enough of them. I like that the recipe is pretty forgiving - if you cook the chicken too long it doesn't really matter because it's in a wonderful sauce that infuses the meat and keeps it moist.	i 'm not a big fan of chipotle peppers - but this recipe made me change my mind about that !! i made enchiladas with them and no one could get enough of them . i like that the recipe is pretty forgiving - if you cook the chicken too long it does n't really matter because it 's in a wonderful sauce that infuses the meat and keeps it moist .	1

Sooo delicious. I served it as a taco salad and topped it with cilantro cotija cheese and a lime wedge. I followed the recipe exactly including using the whole can of chipotle peppers and while it had a nice kick I didn't think it was overwhelmingly spicy.

I made this a few weeks ago and I'm getting ready to make it again this weekend. It was amazingly delicious. I first made the sauce in the blender with the entire can of chipotle peppers but when I tasted it directly from the blender I thought it was way too spicy. So I poured down half of it and added more tomatoes and it was still very spicy but more bearable. Even my son who refuses to eat chicken (only eats beef pork and seafood. I told him it was pork and confessed it was chicken after he ate it) loved it. We made tacos. I will make this often!	i made this a few weeks ago and i 'm getting ready to make it again this weekend . it was amazingly delicious . i first made the sauce in the blender with the entire can of chipotle peppers but when i ta sted it directly from the blender i thought it was way too spicy . so i poured down half of it and added more tomatoes and it was still very spicy but more bearable . even my son who refuses to eat chic ken -lrb- only eats beef pork and seafood . i told him it was pork and confessed it was chicken after he ate it -rrb- loved it . we made tacos . i will make this often !	1
I love this stuffing! This is the second time I've made this and it turned out awesome. Make sure to use a large stock pot to cook the wild rice in because you end up adding a lot more to the pot later on. For the herbs I used 1 Tbsp. rosemary 2 Tbsp. basil 1 Tbsp. oregano 1 Tbsp. thyme 1/2 Tbsp. marjoram and 1/2 tsp. ground sage. I also added 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper. The great thing is you can adjust the herbs according to your tastes. To cut costs I only used raisins and craisins (skipping the apricots and cherries).

I purchased a long grain and wild rice combination and just cooked it up acocrding to the package directions. I used microwave bacon (I hate bacon grease) and set it aside. I sauteed the onion and celery and added the fruit to the rice while the rice was still a little 'wet'. Added the celery and onion the dry herb mix (basil organo thyme sage) to the rice and fruit and cooked on med-low until everything was cooked through. Added the bacon and parley and mixed until warm. This is an incredible dish. DH and I plan on using this a a foundation form here on out and will play around with substituting the bacon for chicken sauage and the fruits and herbs.	i purchased a long grain and wild rice combination and just cooked it up acocrding to the package directions . i used microwave bacon -lrb- i hate bacon grease -rrb- and set it aside . i sauteed the onion and cel ery and added the fruit to the rice while the rice was still a little ` wet ' . added the celery and onion the dry herb mix -lrb- basil organo thyme sage -rrb- to the rice and fruit and cooked on med-low until eve rything was cooked through . added the bacon and parley and mixed until warm . this is an incredible dish . dh and i plan on using this a a foundation form here on out and will play around with substitut ing the bacon for chicken sauage and the fruits and herbs .	1

The instructions for the recipe are not written correctly omitting the broth that is called for in the ingredients list. The uncooked long grain rice do not soften in the time instructed. I think this would be a great recipe if the long grain were pre-cooked and then mixed into the other ingredients. The flavor was good the texture was crunchy. No one would eat it at Thanksgiving.	the instructions for the recipe are not written correctly omitting the broth that is called for in the ingredients list . the uncooked long grain rice do not soften in the time instructed . i think this would be a great recipe if the long grain were pre-cooked and then mixed into the other ingredients . the flavor was good the texture was crunchy . no one would eat it at thanksgiving .	1

For whatever reason this year I had way too many green tomatoes to fry but not enough for a big batch of relish. So time to get creative! In that mindset I tried this pie and I have to say it's good. A little odd but good. One wouldn't think it's apple but it's quite nice. I used tomatoes with a bit of a blush to them and I had to increase the baking time dramatically for the crust to brown. I would also decrease the spices next time-- the cinnamon in particular is a little too much. But it's quite a nice use for those before-the-frost tomatoes! I'll be making this again next year.	for whatever reason this year i had way too many green tomatoes to fry but not enough for a big batch of relish . so time to get creative ! in that mindset i tried this pie and i have to say it 's good . a little odd but good . one would n't think it 's apple but it 's quite nice . i used tomatoes with a bit of a blush to them and i had to increase the baking time dramatically for the crust to brown . i wou ld also decrease the spices next time -- the cinnamon in particular is a little too much . but it 's quite a nice use for those before-the-frost tomatoes ! i 'll be making this again next year .	1

I followed the recipe exactly and added 1 tbsp of cornstarch to prevent watery pie. The taste is extremely odd and is not like apple pie at all.

Very easy prep fast all around I loved this pie and was a disbeliever of anything sweet with green tomatoes. Bravo!! The sweet/cinnamon tastes like apple pie spices. Oh I would not recommend slicing the peppers into long strips as I did (too many dinners what can I say) - this was the only weird texture issue. Yes it was a bit runny am making it again tonight and will add the cornstarch per the suggestion in one of the reviews.	very easy prep fast all around i loved this pie and was a disbeliever of anything sweet with green tomatoes . bravo !! the sweet/cinnamon tastes like apple pie spices . oh i would not recommend slicing t he peppers into long strips as i did -lrb- too many dinners what can i say -rrb- - this was the only weird texture issue . yes it was a bit runny am making it again tonight and will add the cornstarch per the su ggestion in one of the reviews .	1

I thought this was really good. Easy to make and I'd recommend using the thighs versus breasts b/c the meat was moist and tender and I think a breast would be dry. My kids were suspicious of the green color of the soup and unfortunately couldn't get over it. Nonetheless my husband and I really liked the soup and was good with a bit of sour cream and some crushed tortilla chips over top.	i thought this was really good . easy to make and i 'd recommend using the thighs versus breasts b/c the meat was moist and tender and i think a breast would be dry . my kids were suspicious of the green color of the soup and unfortunately could n't get over it . nonetheless my husband and i really liked the soup and was good with a bit of sour cream and some crushed tortilla chips over top .	1

I have made this twice now and it is delicious!

Fantastic! My only variations are to use 8 large chicken thighs (skin on to reduce prep and cleanup time) substitute a dry red wine for the water and use 1 cup of Barilla Marinara for the tomato sauce. NOTE: after browning all the thighs it s a good idea to drain most of the fat before proceeding. I serve over buttered wide egg noodles.	fantastic ! my only variations are to use 8 large chicken thighs -lrb- skin on to reduce prep and cleanup time -rrb- substitute a dry red wine for the water and use 1 cup of barilla marinara for the tomato sauce . note : after browning all the thighs it s a good idea to drain most of the fat before proceeding . i serve over buttered wide egg noodles .	1
Pretty much followed the recipe as is. The only difference was that I seasoned the chicken with Italian seasoning before browning and doubled the tomato sauce. Other than that this came out so yummy and it was so quick and easy to do! Definitely a keeper!

Very good! Used my homemade sauce. I always make a big batch & freeze it in 2 cup batches so I'm always ready when I get the urge to cook. I too spiced it up a little more. Had 2 zucchini that were just about ready for zucchini heaven so I threw them in too slced of course. I have a new electric pressure cooker so next time I'll make this in my P.C. and let you all know how it turns out.	very good ! used my homemade sauce . i always make a big batch & freeze it in 2 cup batches so i 'm always ready when i get the urge to cook . i too spiced it up a little more . had 2 zucchini that were ju st about ready for zucchini heaven so i threw them in too slced of course . i have a new electric pressure cooker so next time i 'll make this in my p.c. and let you all know how it turns out .	1
I made this as written except I used chicken thighs. In the video, I thought he said to keep all the chicken run-off after browning. I wish I would have stuck with my mind and drained it. The meal was so greasy I couldn't taste anything else. If you make this with thighs, PLEASE drain it before putting everything else in. It was a waste of food in my house.	i made this as written except i used chicken thighs . in the video , i thought he said to keep all the chicken run-off after browning . i wish i would have stuck with my mind and drained it . the meal was so greasy i could n't taste anything else . if you make this with thighs , please drain it before putting everything else in . it was a waste of food in my house .	1
Very pleased with this recipe. I had thighs and drumsticks skipped the oregano and used seasoned salt. I also added zucchini as another reviewer suggested.

Delish! I made one minor change: I roasted the squash in the oven and used the already cooked squash in the recipe. I did this because it is so easy to peel/dice cooked butternut squash and such a pain to cut the skins off/dice raw squash.	delish ! i made one minor change : i roasted the squash in the oven and used the already cooked squash in the recipe . i did this because it is so easy to peel/dice cooked butternut squash and such a pai n to cut the skins off/dice raw squash .	2
This was dinner tonight and it was SO GOOD! I suspect the mascarpone cheese might hold some people back from making it. I wanted to include it but couldn't get to the store so I whipped together cream cheese and some kefir and it worked just fine! Maybe the mascarpone would have been even better I'll try it sometime but google substitutions using what you have if that's the only thing standing in your way from this creamy and delicious pasta meal.	this was dinner tonight and it was so good ! i suspect the mascarpone cheese might hold some people back from making it . i wanted to include it but could n't get to the store so i whipped together cream cheese and some kefir and it worked just fine ! maybe the mascarpone would have been even better i 'll try it sometime but google substitutions using what you have if that 's the only thing standing in your way from this creamy and delicious pasta meal .	1

Absolutely delicious! I did something a little different. I put 3 chicken breasts at a time in a 1 gallon freezer bag and pounded the breasts so they were more even in thickness. I also dipped the breasts in butter and then breaded it. I used seasoned cornbread stuffing and of course more curry and parmesean. (because we love curry and parmesean) Then I placed the chicken in a dish sprayed with PAM and turned 1/2 way through cooking. It browned up nicely and the breading stayed on. It was a hit! Plus I made it ahead of time and just had to take it out of the fridge and put in the ove. LOVED IT.

This was a pleasant-tasting and easy to make recipe. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs as a substitute for the stuffing and Italian seasoning. In addition I dipped the chicken in Italian dressing prior to dipping it in the breadcrumb mix. I ate it with Creamy Parmesan Risotto which was a good combination.

This turned out verrrry good I was scared to be the first to try it but I am glad that I did. My grandma always orders moo goo gai pan when we eat out at chinese so I wanted to try this recipe out and hopefully surprise her one day! I think she will be happily surprised with this one! I did change the veggies up a little bit to my liking and how it's served at our local chinese place. I added a head of broccoli and a can of stir fry corn. I left out the bok choy and used bamboo shoots in place of the water chestnuts. I used frozen peas and they worked just fine. For the sauce I did use powdered ginger and a little more than 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I had some cooking white wine that I've had forever but it didn't seem to ruin anything. I added about 1 tbls of soy sauce just because not really sure why. Me and my mom both enjoyed this will make again.

Delicious! I used chicken tenderloins making it really easy to slice. My grocer was out of snow peas so I used sugar snap peas instead. Everything else stayed exactly according to recipe although I doubled it. Such an easy healthy and good recipe!

Eh this was all right. For all the work I did it would've been easier to just call the Chinese food place. The taste was bland something is missing I'm not sure what. I had to triple the sauce and after it was plated added some soy sauce which made it taste better. The plus to this recipe is that you can use whatever veggies you want. I added carrots broccoli and bamboo but didn't use bok choy (didn't have any at the store). Another plus it is a lot healthier then the take out!	eh this was all right . for all the work i did it would 've been easier to just call the chinese food place . the taste was bland something is missing i 'm not sure what . i had to triple the sauce and aft er it was plated added some soy sauce which made it taste better . the plus to this recipe is that you can use whatever veggies you want . i added carrots broccoli and bamboo but did n't use bok choy -lrb- di d n't have any at the store -rrb- . another plus it is a lot healthier then the take out !	1
I did not enjoy this. I had really high hopes as the list of ingredients looked wonderful. The only thing I changed was the veggies. I used carrots and left out bok choy and waterchestnuts. This had absolutely no flavor. I even reread the recipe to make sure I hadnt missed anything. Not sure what went wrong. When I first read the reviews I thought the people who said this had no taste must not have ever had Moo Goo Gai Pan because it is a very mild tasting dish but this is tasteless. oh well! ill keep looking.	i did not enjoy this . i had really high hopes as the list of ingredients looked wonderful . the only thing i changed was the veggies . i used carrots and left out bok choy and waterchestnuts . this had a bsolutely no flavor . i even reread the recipe to make sure i hadnt missed anything . not sure what went wrong . when i first read the reviews i thought the people who said this had no taste must not hav e ever had moo goo gai pan because it is a very mild tasting dish but this is tasteless . oh well ! ill keep looking .	1

I follow this minus the chicken. I like it with just veggies. People keep commenting that this has no flavor yet they leave out main ingredients. Bok choy is essential to the flavor of this dish don't leave it out. I also add about a teaspoon of oyster sauce to the sauce mixture for more depth of Asian flavor. I also use sherry instead of white wine. With my changes it's five star.	i follow this minus the chicken . i like it with just veggies . people keep commenting that this has no flavor yet they leave out main ingredients . bok choy is essential to the flavor of this dish do n't leave it out . i also add about a teaspoon of oyster sauce to the sauce mixture for more depth of asian flavor . i also use sherry instead of white wine . with my changes it 's five star .	1

We frequently go to PF Chang's just for the chicken lettuce wraps so I was gratified to hear my family say that this recipe (with these modifications) tastes BETTER than PF Chang's. Here's what I did: Mix 3/4 cup shredded mushrooms and 1 can drained chopped water chestnuts with the chicken before cooking. Cook them all together. Omit the cherries. Double the sauce ingredients (but omit the honey) and add 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. Add 1/2 tsp garlic powder and some red pepper flakes (to taste) to the sauce. Use the freshest crunchiest inner lettuce cups for best flavor.	we frequently go to pf chang 's just for the chicken lettuce wraps so i was gratified to hear my family say that this recipe -lrb- with these modifications -rrb- tastes better than pf chang 's . here 's what i did : mix 3/4 cup shredded mushrooms and 1 can drained chopped water chestnuts with the chicken before cooking . cook them all together . omit the cherries . double the sauce ingredients -lrb- but omit the honey -rrb- and add 2 tablespoons of soy sauce . add 1/2 tsp garlic powder and some red pepper flakes -lrb- to taste -rrb- to the sauce . use the freshest crunchiest inner lettuce cups for best flavor .	1

Add 1/2 tsp garlic powder and some red pepper flakes (to taste) to the sauce. Use the freshest crunchiest inner lettuce cups for best flavor... Others recomended bib lettuce but my husband prefered the crunch of the iceberg lettuce (I agree) so I'll go back to that next time. It didn't take that long to make (with a food processor) and was soooo good! Next time I'll try making the ginger lemonade with it.	this was wonderful ! my husband loved the ones at p.f. changs so i found this recipe and made it with the changes recomended by sherrybeat : mix 3/4 cup shredded mushrooms and 1 can drained chopped wate r chestnuts with the chicken before cooking . cook them all together . omit the cherries . double the sauce ingredients -lrb- but omit the honey -rrb- and add 2 tablespoons of soy sauce . add 1/2 tsp garlic powder and some red pepper flakes -lrb- to taste -rrb- to the sauce . use the freshest crunchiest inner lettuce cups for best flavor ... others recomended bib lettuce but my husband prefered the crunch of the iceberg le ttuce -lrb- i agree -rrb- so i 'll go back to that next time . it did n't take that long to make -lrb- with a food processor -rrb- and was soooo good ! next time i 'll try making the ginger lemonade with it .	1
This is nice but SOOO much better a day or two later - perfect picnic food. With more chopping than cooking it's a good pick for a novice cook. Use soft flexible lettuce (butter lettuce is great) that won't tear as much - and whatever you do stay away from iceberg.	this is nice but sooo much better a day or two later - perfect picnic food . with more chopping than cooking it 's a good pick for a novice cook . use soft flexible lettuce -lrb- butter lettuce is great -rrb- that wo n't tear as much - and whatever you do stay away from iceberg .	1
I know I've already reviewed this recipe but I just had this again last night (had to wait a whole YEAR for cherries!) and it's still fabulous! In reading the other reviews I had to laugh - some have omitted the cherries! Why bother making chicken CHERRY lettuce wraps if you omit the cherries? Sorry - I really like cherries and this is the best meal I've had in a long time! Healthy lots of flavor simple although somewhat time consuming with the pitting of the cherries. One note about the lettuce - make sure you buy a hearty lettuce. The red leaf was way too thin and flimsy to hold the bundle. I ended up just making a salad of it - which was fine too. I'd pick Romaine or Butter lettuce - something with a stiffer leaf. Thanks Barry for an awesome recipe!	i know i 've already reviewed this recipe but i just had this again last night -lrb- had to wait a whole year for cherries ! -rrb- and it 's still fabulous ! in reading the other reviews i had to laugh - some have omitted the cherries ! why bother making chicken cherry lettuce wraps if you omit the cherries ? sorry - i really like cherries and this is the best meal i 've had in a long time ! healthy lots of flavor simple although somewhat time consuming with the pitting of the cherries . one note about the lettuce - make sure you buy a hearty lettuce . the red leaf was way too thin and flimsy to hold the bundle . i ended up just making a salad of it - which was fine too . i 'd pick romaine or butter lettuce - something with a stiffer leaf . thanks barry for an awesome recipe !	1
We loved these! The reviewers who omitted the cherries missed out...they added great flavor texture & juicyness to the mix. I cut the recipe in half used frozen/thawed rotissirie chicken (sauteed it in the oil & ginger for a couple of minutes to infuse it w/ flavor) I used ginger-in-a-tube (I added extra) & I used finely minced red onion instead of the green onions. I decreased the carrots some & I used red leaf lettuce. Bibb lettuce might make it more convenient to eat but we both liked the slight crunch from the leaf lettuce. Even though I cut the recipe in half & decreased the carrots I made the full recipe of sauce...I'm glad because I think it would have been too dry & not nearly as flavorful w/out it. I also made this up a couple of hours ahaed & kept it in the fridge...I think it needs time for the flavors to meld. I didn't take a pic thinking that there would be leftovers & I could do it the next day in natural light but we ate it all!

I have been wanting to try out this recipe ever since Chef John uploaded it to YouTube. I finally got around to making it a few evenings ago. This is my first time making bread and may I just say how simple it is to make! I got so excited seeing it rise in the oven... And boy, when it came out of the oven and I tried a slice (after letting it cool, of course), the flavor is unparalleled. My family and friends loved it...and with a bit of butter and jam...too delicious!! All I can say is that I won't be buying Irish soda bread from Whole Foods anymore...I'll be making my own!!! Please hurry and make this bread now! Your family and friends (as well as your own taste buds) will thank you later!	i have been wanting to try out this recipe ever since chef john uploaded it to youtube . i finally got around to making it a few evenings ago . this is my first time making bread and may i just say how simple it is to make ! i got so excited seeing it rise in the oven ... and boy , when it came out of the oven and i tried a slice -lrb- after letting it cool , of course -rrb- , the flavor is unparalleled . my family and friends loved it ... and with a bit of butter and jam ... too delicious !! all i can say is that i wo n't be buying irish soda bread from whole foods anymore ... i 'll be making my own !!! please hurry and make this bread now ! your family and friends -lrb- as well as your own taste buds -rrb- will thank you later !	1

For the all star Canada Cooks event I made Chef John's Irish Soda Bread using yogurt instead of buttermilk which made it very moist and delicious. I think this is a good bread to have at a luncheon or with tea.  If you are looking for bread sweetened without sugar this is the one to try with honey and raisins for extra sweetness.	for the all star canada cooks event i made chef john 's irish soda bread using yogurt instead of buttermilk which made it very moist and delicious . i think this is a good bread to have at a luncheon or with tea . if you are looking for bread sweetened without sugar this is the one to try with honey and raisins for extra sweetness .	1

I've been obsessed with Irish soda bread since getting some from a local bakery around St. Patty's. This recipe was outstanding even with a few modifications. I love oats so added an extra 1/4 cup. I subtracted a 1/4 cup flour to keep the dry measures the same. I only used whole wheat flour not all-purpose for part. This created a lovely brown bread. I used fennel seeds in place of the orange zest and I highly recommend this. Finally I realized at the last moment that I didn't have parchment paper so I greased my cast iron skillet and made one large loaf.

I don't bake much, just started making a few loaves of bread this year. And I don't recall eating Irish soda bread anywhere recently so I can't compare my creation to anybody else's. That said, this recipe came out marvelously! Took a lot of work because the dough is so wet and sticky, getting it to set a little so I could handle it was a test of my patience. I didn't have buttermilk so I made my own as per Chef John's blog. But the work paid off because this is a great breakfast bread or perfect with afternoon tea/coffee. Warning; if you're late out of bed you'll likely find it already gone!	i do n't bake much , just started making a few loaves of bread this year . and i do n't recall eating irish soda bread anywhere recently so i ca n't compare my creation to anybody else 's . that said , this r ecipe came out marvelously ! took a lot of work because the dough is so wet and sticky , getting it to set a little so i could handle it was a test of my patience . i did n't have buttermilk so i made my own as per chef john 's blog . but the work paid off because this is a great breakfast bread or perfect with afternoon tea/coffee . warning ; if you 're late out of bed you 'll likely find it already gone !	1

I made the recipe pretty much as written. I increased whole wheat flour to 1 cup and decreased all purpose to 2 3/4 cups. The dough was so wet and unmanageable. I had to dust frequently with flour just to get it off the kneading surface and my hands. So I probably added an extra 1/4 cup of flour. That is why it has a 3 star rating. On the upside I loved the flavor and especially the orange zest that sets it apart from other soda breads. The texture was a bit crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I might make this again...and maybe decreased the buttermilk.	i made the recipe pretty much as written . i increased whole wheat flour to 1 cup and decreased all purpose to 2 3/4 cups . the dough was so wet and unmanageable . i had to dust frequently with flour jus t to get it off the kneading surface and my hands . so i probably added an extra 1/4 cup of flour . that is why it has a 3 star rating . on the upside i loved the flavor and especially the orange zest th at sets it apart from other soda breads . the texture was a bit crispy on the outside and tender on the inside . i might make this again ... and maybe decreased the buttermilk .	1

My first time ever making wings... I'm not a big fan of BBQ. I loved these! couldn't stop eating them. They are nice and spicy but not so much as to hide the excellent flavor. I would never guessed they were baked if I hadn't done it myself. I shook them in a gallon sealed bag to coat them I thought it was easier.	my first time ever making wings ... i 'm not a big fan of bbq . i loved these ! could n't stop eating them . they are nice and spicy but not so much as to hide the excellent flavor . i would never guessed th ey were baked if i had n't done it myself . i shook them in a gallon sealed bag to coat them i thought it was easier .	1
My fiancé is obsessed with wings. He wants to go out for them about once a week. After eating these he said he would never have to go out for wings again. They are absolutely incredible and was easier than I expected them to be.

These were excellent!!! I par broiled and let cool the night before then stuck them in fridge overnight still in par broil recipe. I took them out of that then let them dry the next morning prepared as recipe states then put them in a crockpot on warm to serve at a Sunday football party. Everyone raved about them and wanted the recipe.	these were excellent !!! i par broiled and let cool the night before then stuck them in fridge overnight still in par broil recipe . i took them out of that then let them dry the next morning prepared a s recipe states then put them in a crockpot on warm to serve at a sunday football party . everyone raved about them and wanted the recipe .	1

I'm rating this 4 stars but don't get me wrong, it's very addictive, just be sure everyone in your group loves blue cheese. I prefer the original Frank's recipe which is on this site. If I were to make this one again, I would use either the blue cheese dressing or fresh blue cheese, but not both. I personally thought it was a bit overwhelming. I've done it before with Ranch and the result was amazing.	i 'm rating this 4 stars but do n't get me wrong , it 's very addictive , just be sure everyone in your group loves blue cheese . i prefer the original frank 's recipe which is on this site . if i were to mak e this one again , i would use either the blue cheese dressing or fresh blue cheese , but not both . i personally thought it was a bit overwhelming . i 've done it before with ranch and the result was amaz ing .	2
I found a way to make EVERYONE happy! I made 1 1/2 recipes. With half of the mix I used pepper jack cheese blue cheese dressing and a scant 1/4C blue cheese crumbles. With the other I used cheddar/jack cheese ranch dressing and 1 tsp. of powdered ranch dressing mix. Served them side by side with some blue cheese crumbles to spoon on top as they chose. I did use low or reduced fat ingredients where I could but that's my personal take. HINT: Blue cheese can be pricey and extras spoil if you don't use it frequently. I always buy the amount I need at the salad bar in my local grocery. It's less expensive by the pound there and I don't end up with a lot of leftovers to worry about wasting.	i found a way to make everyone happy ! i made 1 1/2 recipes . with half of the mix i used pepper jack cheese blue cheese dressing and a scant 1/4 c blue cheese crumbles . with the other i used cheddar/jac k cheese ranch dressing and 1 tsp . of powdered ranch dressing mix . served them side by side with some blue cheese crumbles to spoon on top as they chose . i did use low or reduced fat ingredients where i could but that 's my personal take . hint : blue cheese can be pricey and extras spoil if you do n't use it frequently . i always buy the amount i need at the salad bar in my local grocery . it 's less ex pensive by the pound there and i do n't end up with a lot of leftovers to worry about wasting .	1
I made this dip back on Super Bowl Sunday for a potluck party and got mixed reviews. I am one who does definitely prefer bleu cheese to ranch on my buffalo style wings but it seems that not everyone has my good taste! The bleu cheese taste was a bit strong however but that may be because of the dressing that I use which is Bob's Big Boy brand. It is a very rich dressing. I may temper it by halving the bleu cheese dressing and adding in some ranch next time. Not sure. Anyway 5 stars because I loved it and I'm sure that it can be made a little less potent so as to please most everyone.	i made this dip back on super bowl sunday for a potluck party and got mixed reviews . i am one who does definitely prefer bleu cheese to ranch on my buffalo style wings but it seems that not everyone h as my good taste ! the bleu cheese taste was a bit strong however but that may be because of the dressing that i use which is bob 's big boy brand . it is a very rich dressing . i may temper it by halving the bleu cheese dressing and adding in some ranch next time . not sure . anyway 5 stars because i loved it and i 'm sure that it can be made a little less potent so as to please most everyone .	1

Liked by most adults despised by most teenagers! I brought some to an adult Superbowl party and served with celery and Chicken n Biscuit crackers and it was well received. Brought the same dish to a high school event and it was out and out rejected. Eew...blue cheese. Be aware of your audience folks.

After Reading The Reviews I Made The Recipe With A Couple Of Minor Changes.

This dip turned out much spicier than I predicted. Some people really liked it but it was a bit too hot for others. I followed the suggestions of others and omitted the blue cheese crumbles (only used the blue cheese dressing). Next time I will cut the amount of hot sauce in half.	this dip turned out much spicier than i predicted . some people really liked it but it was a bit too hot for others . i followed the suggestions of others and omitted the blue cheese crumbles -lrb- only used the blue cheese dressing -rrb- . next time i will cut the amount of hot sauce in half .	1
Not for the faint of heart. The chicken is extremely spicy. The blueberry sauce really helps to tone down the heat but I would reduce the spice a little next time.	not for the faint of heart . the chicken is extremely spicy . the blueberry sauce really helps to tone down the heat but i would reduce the spice a little next time .	1

Even though this was a lot of work I give it a 5 because it was awesome. You can taste the different flavors separately and thogether they blend perfectly. I followed this recipe to a T and it came out super. I didn't have any issues with the sauce not thickening but if you're worried about it I suggest a) either not adding all of the cream at the end which I suspect wouldn't change the flavor that much or b) before adding the cream mix into it 1 or 2 TBSP flour mix it up and then pour it in and cook for a few minutes.

Really really good. It makes a ton--at least 6 GIANT servings. I followed the recipe except I used a heaping teaspoon of chicken base paste (like bouillon from Sam's) instead of broth or water. I then added sauteed mushrooms at the end (after tasting) and I really loved the addition. I don't know how thick the sauce is supposed to be but it was a bit thin easily swiped up with crusty bread. I'd bet slightly underdoing the pasta and then cooking it a while in the sauce would thicken it by soaking into the pasta. Last but not least I had to use a big pot NOT a skillet. I'm surprised no one else commented on this.

This was awesome. I made it like the recipe said but accidentally doubled the sun-dried tomatoes. I think I'll do that on purpose next time. In addition I'll probably add a few more pine nuts at the end because I like the flavor and the crunch. Like others noted it says it will feed 6 but the truth is it will feed them not only dinner but lunch as well!:) The one thing that surprised me was that I was using a super larger skillet and by the time I got to the last step there wasn't enough room. I had to dump it all in the large pot I had used to cook the pasta. So keep that in mind if you make the 6-serving recipe. The leftovers were great for lunch the next several days. I'm recommending this recipe to all the cooks I know.	this was awesome . i made it like the recipe said but accidentally doubled the sun-dried tomatoes . i think i 'll do that on purpose next time . in addition i 'll probably add a few more pine nuts at the e nd because i like the flavor and the crunch . like others noted it says it will feed 6 but the truth is it will feed them not only dinner but lunch as well ! :-rrb- the one thing that surprised me was that i was using a super larger skillet and by the time i got to the last step there was n't enough room . i had to dump it all in the large pot i had used to cook the pasta . so keep that in mind if you make the 6 serving recipe . the leftovers were great for lunch the next several days . i 'm recommending this recipe to all the cooks i know .	1
I signed up for ALL Recipies today just to rate this recipie. Made it after getting a cuisinart Food Processor for Christmas. Man it was absolutley fantastic. I sliced the chicken into small pieces and only used 4 breasts after seeing the amount of chicken I had piled up. I followed the rest to the letter. I would suggest it makes about 12 servings (possibly more). The flavor was fantastic and my wife was very impressed. This WILL be a recipie I will use when we have special guests come over for dinner!

This sauce came out creamier than the picture. Perhaps pulsing would retain some of the texture. It has a good taste with a little acidic tingle. Different but not off-putting.

Wow! It really does taste like apple pie. I actually peeled the tomatoes (a knife worked easier than a veggie peeler for me) since that's what I do with apples. I upped the flour to about 1/3 cup and ended up baking it for an hour. It came out great- not too runny like some reviews said.	wow ! it really does taste like apple pie . i actually peeled the tomatoes -lrb- a knife worked easier than a veggie peeler for me -rrb- since that 's what i do with apples . i upped the flour to about 1/3 cup and ended up baking it for an hour . it came out great - not too runny like some reviews said .	1

I made alterations to this recipe based on the reviews on all of the Green Tomato Pie Recipes. My pie was delicious and a big hit with my family. Even the ones that were only going to 'taste' it and were sure they weren't going to like it. I proved them wrong. To prevent some of the 'runny filling' issues I added 2 tablespoons of corn starch to the filling mixture. Then I melted some butter in a pan added the filling and cooked it until it was thick. I let it cool before putting in the pie crust. For my version I sliced the tomatoes quite thin maybe an 1/8 inch. I also doubled the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg. For my next pie I would use more than 4 cups of sliced tomatoes...just to have more filling in the pie. The more tomatoes added also add more sugar.	i made alterations to this recipe based on the reviews on all of the green tomato pie recipes . my pie was delicious and a big hit with my family . even the ones that were only going to ` taste ' it and w ere sure they were n't going to like it . i proved them wrong . to prevent some of the ` runny filling ' issues i added 2 tablespoons of corn starch to the filling mixture . then i melted some butter in a p an added the filling and cooked it until it was thick . i let it cool before putting in the pie crust . for my version i sliced the tomatoes quite thin maybe an 1/8 inch . i also doubled the amount of ci nnamon and nutmeg . for my next pie i would use more than 4 cups of sliced tomatoes ... just to have more filling in the pie . the more tomatoes added also add more sugar .	1
I've got so many green tomatoes I figured I might as well try this. The flavor is different not in a bad way just undescribable. The only really bad thing about this pie is the chewy texture.

Oh WOW this is FANTASTIC! I halved the recipe using some beautiful ripe tomatoes from my dad's garden. I'm now wishing that I made the whole recipe b/c I can't stop eating it lol. After tasting it my first thought was crackers w/ cream cheese and this on top...AWESOME! I also plan on trying this on hot dogs/smoked sausages and grilled chicken which I think would be wonderful. When this first started to boil/cook I was worried b/c the tomato skins were coming off and I thought I should've peeled them first but once it was all done everything was 'candied' and you couldn't even tell. Mine took less than an hour to fully thicken so maybe just keep an eye on it while it's going so it doesn't burn. I will def be making this often...it's super easy and super good YUM!

I happened to stumble upon this recipe recommended on the Buzz. Perfect timing as I had some late tomatoes in my garden to use up before the frost did them in. I only had regular bacon so I decided to add a bit of cumin to lend some smoky flavor. This is amazing- absolutely delicious! Thanks for sharing a great recipe:)	i happened to stumble upon this recipe recommended on the buzz . perfect timing as i had some late tomatoes in my garden to use up before the frost did them in . i only had regular bacon so i decided to add a bit of cumin to lend some smoky flavor . this is amazing - absolutely delicious ! thanks for sharing a great recipe :-rrb-	1
Me and my oldest son were bored this evening so we decided to give this recipe a shot. I didn't have any fresh tomatoes so we used canned petite diced so we cut the recipe in half in case it didn't work with the canned variety. It did! We loved loved this its so good! We made bagel chips to eat with it very very yummy!	me and my oldest son were bored this evening so we decided to give this recipe a shot . i did n't have any fresh tomatoes so we used canned petite diced so we cut the recipe in half in case it did n't wo rk with the canned variety . it did ! we loved loved this its so good ! we made bagel chips to eat with it very very yummy !	1
Delicious! I was looking for something to take to a party and stumbled upon this. it sounded so good I made a double batch to make sure I'd have some leftover...and so glad I did because it was gone quickly at the party. I cut the salt back just a little (although I think it would have been fine at the suggested amount) and forgot to add the optional hot sauce. I simply served it with pieces of crusty bread and it was very yummy. The next day I had some on a bagel with cream cheese and it was super good.	delicious ! i was looking for something to take to a party and stumbled upon this . it sounded so good i made a double batch to make sure i 'd have some leftover ... and so glad i did because it was gone q uickly at the party . i cut the salt back just a little -lrb- although i think it would have been fine at the suggested amount -rrb- and forgot to add the optional hot sauce . i simply served it with pieces of cr usty bread and it was very yummy . the next day i had some on a bagel with cream cheese and it was super good .	1
This was excellent! I'm not a big Dijon mustard fan. But this was really good! I would definitely do it again! I didn't have red wine vinegar and used apple cider vinegar. Didn't have cayenne and used red pepper flakes. I'm usually a purist to sticking to the recipe as written. But I'm broke! So buying additional stuff just wasn't happening this week!	this was excellent ! i 'm not a big dijon mustard fan . but this was really good ! i would definitely do it again ! i did n't have red wine vinegar and used apple cider vinegar . did n't have cayenne and used red pepper flakes . i 'm usually a purist to sticking to the recipe as written . but i 'm broke ! so buying additional stuff just was n't happening this week !	1
I suggest using Pyrex. My heavy duty baking sheet warped in the high temps and no need for foil with the lightly greased dish. This also made it easier pouring the drippings into the saucepan....also... double the onion......

Made this recipe for my family with boneless skinless chicken thighs and they just loved it - we left out the chipotle and cayenne due to personal preference. They raved over the onions and couldn't stop talking about it!

This was a perfect chicken dish...first off - thighs. You can't do better than tender juicy thighs. The seasoning was out of this world and it imparted such a wonderful crusty finish. Try this.

Marinated for 6 hrs. using boneless skinless thighs. Between Chef John's comment and another reviewer I figured they would work fine. Trouble is cooking time should be adjusted. Boneless cook faster than bone-in. I took the thighs out earlier than what the recipe called for (could tell they were done) but they were still a bit dry. I was also expecting more flavor 'pop' with the ingredients of the marinade. Might give it another whirl with bone-in.	marinated for 6 hrs . using boneless skinless thighs . between chef john 's comment and another reviewer i figured they would work fine . trouble is cooking time should be adjusted . boneless cook faster t han bone-in . i took the thighs out earlier than what the recipe called for -lrb- could tell they were done -rrb- but they were still a bit dry . i was also expecting more flavor ` pop ' with the ingredients of the marinade . might give it another whirl with bone-in .	1

This was different and really good on the grill. We had with rice and a salad tonight. Tomorrow I will shred the left overs for tacos. I did add a tablespoon of sugar because my juices tasted too sour for me. But I think a little more would have been fine. I will go with 2 tablespoons in the future depending on the sweetness of my juices. Otherwise I made it according to directions. A cilantro sprinkling was a great idea. I didn't go with the cabbage but will try it next time.

Absolutely delicious! Tangy spicy juicy awesome! Kept with the recipe except for cayenne and substituted 2 tsp adobo sauce and onions (from a can of chilies in adobo) since I didn't have any dried chipotle peppers. The only problem I had was getting it to cook through since i rarely bbq pork. I overcooked it and it was still amazing!

Very tasty. I followed this recipe to the letter. It’s way too soft and soggy due to, I would guess, the chicken stock. The last time I made it I found a similar recipe that lacks the balsamic vinegar, and chicken stock. Everything else was  basically the same. That recipe was much better and the leftovers were still tasty.	very tasty . i followed this recipe to the letter . it 's way too soft and soggy due to , i would guess , the chicken stock . the last time i made it i found a similar recipe that lacks the balsamic vinegar , and chicken stock . everything else was basically the same . that recipe was much better and the leftovers were still tasty .	1
Really good.  Added some fresh parmesan at the end and it worked well.  Love this because it is so easy, no special ingredients and is an amazing way to get kids to eat vegetables...our girls loved it.

Made it as written and it was very good.  But I felt that it could do with less bacon/drippings and would still be good.  The method of preparations was simple.  I think that next time, and there will be a next time,  that I would  reduce the amount of the bacon/drippings and the butter.  With all the fat that's in this recipe, it turns a very healthy side dish into one that's high in calories and fats.	made it as written and it was very good . but i felt that it could do with less bacon/drippings and would still be good . the method of preparations was simple . i think that next time , and there will be a next time , that i would reduce the amount of the bacon/drippings and the butter . with all the fat that 's in this recipe , it turns a very healthy side dish into one that 's high in calories and fats .	1

Oh My Goodness...made these this evening. Shaved them with my ceramic slicer and nothing could be easier. Used olive oil and butter then tossed in some REAL bacon bits at the end...Let them sit in the pan long enough to get a bit of brown/caramalized and they were delicious and nutty...even the teenaged boys who turned up their noses dove back for seconds. FOUR teens ate brussels sprouts!!! Hades has frozen over in our city.

I have been making a similar recipe for years and it has been a hit with even the non-brussel sprout lovers. I make it with a few differences.....instead of almonds I use pine nuts. this is a very nice taste saute until lightly toasted and use seasoning salt. Also at he end with the crumbled bacon add sliced green onion tops.

I agree that this recipe is a great crowd pleaser but 4 pounds of Brussels sprouts is WAY too much. I used half that amount with the same amount of the other ingredients and it worked perfectly. I served it for 8 people and we had plenty of leftovers which reheated surprisingly well.	i agree that this recipe is a great crowd pleaser but 4 pounds of brussels sprouts is way too much . i used half that amount with the same amount of the other ingredients and it worked perfectly . i ser ved it for 8 people and we had plenty of leftovers which reheated surprisingly well .	1

This was great. We used about 2 lbs or less of sprouts. My husband cut the sprouts up in 1/3's or 1/4's and it still turned out great. We realized we didn't have almonds and used pistachios and still good. I'd recommend this to brussel sprout fans.	this was great . we used about 2 lbs or less of sprouts . my husband cut the sprouts up in 1/3 's or 1/4 's and it still turned out great . we realized we did n't have almonds and used pistachios and still good . i 'd recommend this to brussel sprout fans .	1

Very good!! My husband and I loved it. I did half the recipe and it was still a HUGE amount... could have fed a family of 6 easily. Make sure you use thick slices of bacon so that you get enough fat to cook with also make sure you slice them thin. I got a little lazy near the end of my slicing and the thick pieces took longer to cook. This is a fantastic recipe and I will be making it for years to come!	very good !! my husband and i loved it . i did half the recipe and it was still a huge amount ... could have fed a family of 6 easily . make sure you use thick slices of bacon so that you get enough fat t o cook with also make sure you slice them thin . i got a little lazy near the end of my slicing and the thick pieces took longer to cook . this is a fantastic recipe and i will be making it for years to come !	1
Sounded great but was NOT exciting. It made way too much (and we eat large portions of veg) needed to cook A LOT longer than stated and I had to add oil while cooking to help wilt it. It's possible that since I used center cut bacon that was the problem but I will not be making this recipe as written again. I too had to doctor this up to eat it and was left with a big ol' container of leftovers that nobody ate.	sounded great but was not exciting . it made way too much -lrb- and we eat large portions of veg -rrb- needed to cook a lot longer than stated and i had to add oil while cooking to help wilt it . it 's possible th at since i used center cut bacon that was the problem but i will not be making this recipe as written again . i too had to doctor this up to eat it and was left with a big ol' container of leftovers th at nobody ate .	1
This was great! My parents loved it. I messed up at first and put the mixture in a little hot, warning let it completely cool down! The dough will rip and the liquid will seep out. I also didn't pinch the edges good enough. Then I made more and they came out great. I also added blueberries into the second batch with the apples which was really nice too.	this was great ! my parents loved it . i messed up at first and put the mixture in a little hot , warning let it completely cool down ! the dough will rip and the liquid will seep out . i also did n't pinch the edges good enough . then i made more and they came out great . i also added blueberries into the second batch with the apples which was really nice too .	1

Thank you so much for this recipe! I had some store-bought pie dough that I had to use up as we had no electricity for a day due to an earthquake. The only fruit I had in the house was one nectarine but I remembered that green tomatoes could be used when you don't have enough apples so I used one large nectarine and two small green tomatoes for the filling. The only other thing I changed was to substitute vanilla for some of the cinnamon. My gas oven runs a little hot so they turned out a little brown but so delicious!

I know people will hate me for this so my apologies in advance but I wanted to make cherry turnovers (without frying) and had no idea how to do it.

Whoa! So much cinnamon! So much sugar! It was way too sweet and I couldn't even taste the apples so I tossed it and started again so as not to waste the pie crust. I'm going to go with half the white sugar and a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon which is 1/6 what the recipe calls for.	whoa ! so much cinnamon ! so much sugar ! it was way too sweet and i could n't even taste the apples so i tossed it and started again so as not to waste the pie crust . i 'm going to go with half the white sugar and a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon which is 1/6 what the recipe calls for .	1
Great flavor but next time I am using chicken thighs not chicken breasts. Thighs are much more suited to low and slow cooking. The chicken breasts got really dry. Also give this a stir once in awhile as it stews in the slow cooker. All that sweetness has a tendency to burn if your slow cooker gets hot spots.

Love this Moroccan dish can also be made with lamb! I've never made mine in a slow cooker before only on the stove and this turned out just as good!

I only had bone-in chicken so cooked it most of the way then pulled the meat off the bone and threw it back into the slow cooker. It didn't dry out as much as I thought it might.

4 stars for ease and convenience. I suateed my onion first before adding to the crockpot. Bone in chicken works fine too. The bones come right off after cooking. Adding raisins towards the end of the cooking would help as they are quite unappetizing with such a long cooking time. This will be a staple in my chicken recipes.	4 stars for ease and convenience . i suateed my onion first before adding to the crockpot . bone in chicken works fine too . the bones come right off after cooking . adding raisins towards the end of the cooking would help as they are quite unappetizing with such a long cooking time . this will be a staple in my chicken recipes .	1
This did not do it for me. The combination of spices added some pepperiness but no real heat or flavor and just tasted odd with the sweetness of the apricots. Somehow with all those spices it still tasted bland. I added some paprika more cumin and some honey to try to brighten up the taste but it still tasted blah to us.

A very good and easy soup. I used a large baking potato so the soup was nice and thick after blending. Also I didn't add the thawed broccoli until the potato was already tender and just cooked it a few minutes more so that the broccoli kept a nice green color and fresh flavor. My family including my 9-yr. old son really liked this soup.	a very good and easy soup . i used a large baking potato so the soup was nice and thick after blending . also i did n't add the thawed broccoli until the potato was already tender and just cooked it a fe w minutes more so that the broccoli kept a nice green color and fresh flavor . my family including my 9 yr . old son really liked this soup .	1
I was worried after reading other reviews of this recipe but gave it a try anyhow because it looked so easy. It turned out terrific!! It was a little bland but I just added some chopped fresh sage and a little season salt and it turned out great! And you can't beat it for healthy. For my husband I stirred a 1/4 c of chopped proscuitto (you could use ham too) into his and he loved it. I also doubled the potato as per previous reviews here and I loved the thick texture. I will definitely put this in our monthly rotation - thanks Lon!	i was worried after reading other reviews of this recipe but gave it a try anyhow because it looked so easy . it turned out terrific !! it was a little bland but i just added some chopped fresh sage and a little season salt and it turned out great ! and you ca n't beat it for healthy . for my husband i stirred a 1/4 c of chopped proscuitto -lrb- you could use ham too -rrb- into his and he loved it . i also double d the potato as per previous reviews here and i loved the thick texture . i will definitely put this in our monthly rotation - thanks lon !	1
This recipe rocks especially if you're obsessed with soup like I am! It's totally easy and totally tweakable. I used fresh broccoli two small red potatoes with the skins on and omitted the nutmeg (had none in the house). I also threw some reduced-fat white cheddar cheese in the bowl and it got all melty and delicious and tasted as good as the Panera broccoli cheddar I love but can no longer eat because it's awful for you. But even with the cheese this recipe is low-cal.

I also used evaporated skim milk to make it creamier but the potato pretty much does that on its own. Love this soup!!!	fabulous broccoli soup ! i too used fresh broccoli omitted the nutmeg and added red pepper flakes to give it some kick . really adds to the flavor . i also used evaporated skim milk to make it creamier b ut the potato pretty much does that on its own . love this soup !!!	1
Very good! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken because I'm a vegetarian.  This soup is excellent for a low calorie soup.  I will make it again.	very good ! i used vegetable broth instead of chicken because i 'm a vegetarian . this soup is excellent for a low calorie soup . i will make it again .	1
This is SO GOOD and super easy! I added an extra small potato because other reviews said it was not thik enough and it was SO thick I could have eaten it with a fork! But good I also added 2 stalks celery. YUM YUM YUM! Will make again and again (with just one potato)!	this is so good and super easy ! i added an extra small potato because other reviews said it was not thik enough and it was so thick i could have eaten it with a fork ! but good i also added 2 stalks ce lery . yum yum yum ! will make again and again -lrb- with just one potato -rrb- !	1
After reading some great & some not so great reviews I decided to give this soup a try even though my first impression of the ingredients did not appeal to me. Should have stuck with my first impression because I found it very bland and watery. I used fresh broccoli which may have affected it some and left out the nutmeg. After doctoring it up with some cream cheddar cheese and butter and also thickening it with some flour it was much better. This one is not a keeper for me.	after reading some great & some not so great reviews i decided to give this soup a try even though my first impression of the ingredients did not appeal to me . should have stuck with my first impressi on because i found it very bland and watery . i used fresh broccoli which may have affected it some and left out the nutmeg . after doctoring it up with some cream cheddar cheese and butter and also thi ckening it with some flour it was much better . this one is not a keeper for me .	1
AWESOME! I served this for Bunko and the ladies all loved it and asked for the recipe! The first batch I made I followed recipe exactly except for leaving out the bacon cuz we have a vegetarian in our group and made some changes for the 2nd batch which made it even better (I think!). I reduced the milk to 3 cups whole 2 cups 1% (cuz that's what we have on hand) and 1 cup chicken broth. (Because the soup is so darned thick and extremely rich!) I also sauteed 1 finely minced carrot for a minute or two then added 1 minced onion and 1 minced celery stalk til all was soft and tender then put in a minced garlic clove and sauteed for about another minute. Pureed the entire thing in my Cuisinart and stirred it into the soup along with the cheese et al. Gave it even MORE flavor--totally over the top! I then ended up stirring the two batches together and dumping the entire thing in my crock pot! I put chopped green onion bacon cheese and sour cream in little bowls for everyone to top as they wanted. Yum!	awesome ! i served this for bunko and the ladies all loved it and asked for the recipe ! the first batch i made i followed recipe exactly except for leaving out the bacon cuz we have a vegetarian in our group and made some changes for the 2 nd batch which made it even better -lrb- i think ! -rrb- . i reduced the milk to 3 cups whole 2 cups 1 % -lrb- cuz that 's what we have on hand -rrb- and 1 cup chicken broth . -lrb- because th e soup is so darned thick and extremely rich ! -rrb- i also sauteed 1 finely minced carrot for a minute or two then added 1 minced onion and 1 minced celery stalk til all was soft and tender then put in a m inced garlic clove and sauteed for about another minute . pureed the entire thing in my cuisinart and stirred it into the soup along with the cheese et al. . gave it even more flavor -- totally over the to p ! i then ended up stirring the two batches together and dumping the entire thing in my crock pot ! i put chopped green onion bacon cheese and sour cream in little bowls for everyone to top as they wan ted . yum !	1
Excellent soup. I used non-fat milk lower fat cheese and light sour cream. And I kept adding milk to it to thin it out during cooking (definitely no need for whole milk.) I added more black pepper no salt (didn't need it) and used real bacon pieces. I also cut up about half the potatoes into chunks and the rest I chopped more finely. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! It's a keeper.	excellent soup . i used non-fat milk lower fat cheese and light sour cream . and i kept adding milk to it to thin it out during cooking -lrb- definitely no need for whole milk . -rrb- i added more black pepper no salt -lrb- did n't need it -rrb- and used real bacon pieces . i also cut up about half the potatoes into chunks and the rest i chopped more finely . thanks so much for sharing this recipe ! it 's a keeper .	1
This was excellent everyone loved it. I only made minor changes - 6 spuds instead of 9 and I slightly undercooked them in the microwave and then cut them into small hunks when cooled. Then once I had the soup base thickened I threw it all in the crockpot for several hours on low until the potatoes were totally cooked.	this was excellent everyone loved it . i only made minor changes - 6 spuds instead of 9 and i slightly undercooked them in the microwave and then cut them into small hunks when cooled . then once i had the soup base thickened i threw it all in the crockpot for several hours on low until the potatoes were totally cooked .	1
Wonderful recipe for people new to making soup. It's also an easy recipe to accomodate to your tastes. I'm a vegetarian so I took out the bacon. I also substituted vidalia onions for green onions and replaced the whole milk with skim. You can try soy bacon bits but I find they become soggy. Also try adding chopped potato skins (it has all the nutrients) to the soup to make it chunkier or add milk continuously to thin it out. Even though I now need a full membership to the local gym due to this soup it's worth it.

Thanks for posting such an easy recipe. I have made this twice and I've made the following changes.....I added a can of golden mushroom soup (plus a can of water) I substitued chives for green onions and I doubled the bacon. Delicioso! p.s. I have also made a lower-fat version using a combination of Butter and Olive Oil for the butter 1% milk for the whole milk and substituting canadian bacon for bacon. I also used 8 oz. fat free cream cheese and 2 cups of beef broth to substitute for sour cream and substituted laughing cow light cheese (3 triangles of the garlic/herb flavor) for the shredded cheddar......just as good and maybe better!!	thanks for posting such an easy recipe . i have made this twice and i 've made the following changes ... i added a can of golden mushroom soup -lrb- plus a can of water -rrb- i substitued chives for green onions and i doubled the bacon . delicioso ! p.s. i have also made a lower-fat version using a combination of butter and olive oil for the butter 1 % milk for the whole milk and substituting canadian bacon for bacon . i also used 8 oz . fat free cream cheese and 2 cups of beef broth to substitute for sour cream and substituted laughing cow light cheese -lrb- 3 triangles of the garlic/herb flavor -rrb- for the shredded cheddar ... just as good and maybe better !!	1
This soup is wonderful. I have tried many recipes but this one is JUST right. I reduced the fat a bit by using reduced fat sour cream using skim milk rather than whole milk reduced the cheddar cheese to about 6 ounces and only used 1/2 cup flour. It tasted just like restaurant potato soup.	this soup is wonderful . i have tried many recipes but this one is just right . i reduced the fat a bit by using reduced fat sour cream using skim milk rather than whole milk reduced the cheddar cheese to about 6 ounces and only used 1/2 cup flour . it tasted just like restaurant potato soup .	1

very good! I used a KRAFT red pepper vinaigrette because i couldn't find the sun-dried tomato kind. I added extra veggies (red pepper zucchini) and cooked them in the dressing for a while to marinate them a bit. I also marinated the chicken in the dressing for a while too.

This recipe is very tasty. I was surprised by how much flavor the chicken had. It was very moist also. (Be sure to let it rest before slicing.) I sliced the chicken very thinly and we had leftovers for chicken salad the next day. The sauce is very rich and flavorful. The only downside is that my tomatoes were too tart. Next time I'll use halved cherry tomatoes on the vine. They are sweeter and have a better texture when cooked.	this recipe is very tasty . i was surprised by how much flavor the chicken had . it was very moist also . -lrb- be sure to let it rest before slicing . -rrb- i sliced the chicken very thinly and we had leftovers fo r chicken salad the next day . the sauce is very rich and flavorful . the only downside is that my tomatoes were too tart . next time i 'll use halved cherry tomatoes on the vine . they are sweeter and hav e a better texture when cooked .	1
This was a great early spring way to enjoy tomato and basil pasta one of our summer favorites. Next time I'll add some garlic. I squeezed a bit of lemon juice on after my first bit for some extra tang.

We just made this recipe tonight and it was delicious! We did not have grape or cherry tomatoes but diced up a few Roma tomatoes. We also cut up zucchini and yellow squash to give it some extra color and sneak in veggies for our daughter. It was perfect and we look forward to making this again.

Marinate and grill the chicken it is amazing! It adds a nice charred flavor. I always use fresh garlic in this recipe and somtimes I use the garlic phiadelphia cooking creme instead of regular cream cheese. You might want to double the sauce recipe too because you just can't get enough of it.	marinate and grill the chicken it is amazing ! it adds a nice charred flavor . i always use fresh garlic in this recipe and somtimes i use the garlic phiadelphia cooking creme instead of regular cream c heese . you might want to double the sauce recipe too because you just ca n't get enough of it .	1
I have some chicken breast on the fridge that I don't know what to do- then I saw Kraft video on making this easy chicken in creamy pan sauce- I quickly grabbed my chicken and cream cheese- added caper and chicken broth- it was really good and easy to make! I would definitely make this again- It is even better the next day- the cream cheese make it salty- so no need to add salt- I think a little bit of lemon would be great as well!	i have some chicken breast on the fridge that i do n't know what to do - then i saw kraft video on making this easy chicken in creamy pan sauce - i quickly grabbed my chicken and cream cheese - added cape r and chicken broth - it was really good and easy to make ! i would definitely make this again - it is even better the next day - the cream cheese make it salty - so no need to add salt - i think a little b it of lemon would be great as well !	1

I made this last night and the sauce ruined the chicken! Although I am a big fan of cream cheese this came out a runny mess. I thought the bits and chicken broth would add depth but it still tastes like warm melted cream cheese poured over chicken. This recipes was a waste of perfectly good chicken breasts. I was surprised too because I usually love the recipes I try from the kraft magazine.

This was very good I did make a few changes of my own. When melting the cream cheese I added garlic powder pepper onion powder(just a pinch) and chopped up red pepper. To top it off I used cilantro instead of parsley and a little bit of grated sharp cheddar. It was tasty my fiance was raving about it all night! I went by the recipe for 2 servings I think next time I will adjust the amounts it could have used a little more cream cheese and oil.	this was very good i did make a few changes of my own . when melting the cream cheese i added garlic powder pepper onion powder -lrb- just a pinch -rrb- and chopped up red pepper . to top it off i used cilantro in stead of parsley and a little bit of grated sharp cheddar . it was tasty my fiance was raving about it all night ! i went by the recipe for 2 servings i think next time i will adjust the amounts it coul d have used a little more cream cheese and oil .	1
Loved the recipe. I did add some extras to it. I added a sprinkle of garlic powder and onion powder to the flour mixture along with ground pepper then cooked it in the olive oil. I allowed it to brown very lightly and it was awesome. When the sauce was simmering I added some sun-dried tomatoes that enhanced the taste and gave it some color. Served with rice and broccoli and makes a great dish.

This was really good. I followed the recipe for the most part. I didn't have brown rice so I used instant white rice instead and added about 12oz of spinach instead of 10 oz. This recipe was quick and easy to make on a week-night. It was creamy and thick. I wished that I would have added a bit more salad dressing and chicken broth upfront but overall I'm pleased with this recipe. I'll certainly make it again.	this was really good . i followed the recipe for the most part . i did n't have brown rice so i used instant white rice instead and added about 12 oz of spinach instead of 10 oz . this recipe was quick and easy to make on a week-night . it was creamy and thick . i wished that i would have added a bit more salad dressing and chicken broth upfront but overall i 'm pleased with this recipe . i 'll certainly ma ke it again .	1
Enjoyed this recipe a lot although altered it significantly due to lack of exact ingredients. I used balsamic vinaigrette. I used a bit over a pound of chicken (one 2 breast pack of Costco's sealed 6 pack) I added one chopped up roasted red pepper towards the end but would recommend adding at the beginning to spread the flavor. I had no chicken broth so used ground beef broth from which I had removed the fat. I added a bit of water so I'd have enough liquid. Rather than cream cheese I used about 1/3 cup of sour cream. Loved the recommendation of just letting the spinach just wilt. I tend to overcook spinach. After letting the spinach stand covered for 5 min I added a bunch of grape tomatoes cut in half. They heated up from the warmth of the rest and it tasted great and looked great. The parmesan adds a lot of flavor. Thanks for submitting! I have never rated before but my husband and I really liked this meal.	enjoyed this recipe a lot although altered it significantly due to lack of exact ingredients . i used balsamic vinaigrette . i used a bit over a pound of chicken -lrb- one 2 breast pack of costco 's sealed 6 pack -rrb- i added one chopped up roasted red pepper towards the end but would recommend adding at the beginning to spread the flavor . i had no chicken broth so used ground beef broth from which i had remo ved the fat . i added a bit of water so i 'd have enough liquid . rather than cream cheese i used about 1/3 cup of sour cream . loved the recommendation of just letting the spinach just wilt . i tend to ov ercook spinach . after letting the spinach stand covered for 5 min i added a bunch of grape tomatoes cut in half . they heated up from the warmth of the rest and it tasted great and looked great . the pa rmesan adds a lot of flavor . thanks for submitting ! i have never rated before but my husband and i really liked this meal .	1
This was amazing!! I cheated because I was starving after work. I used a handful of the precooked chicken breast strips didn't have the same dressing so just used a couple squirts of the O&V that I had & a touch of minced garlic. I added a small can of mushrooms at this point WITH most of the juice(didn't have broth)and a cup of minute brown rice (after microwaving). I only used a couple spoonfuls of cream cheese though. Enough to trick myself into thinking it was alfredo but less calories. (half fat) It totally worked!!! I seriously want to like the pan while it's still hot!	this was amazing !! i cheated because i was starving after work . i used a handful of the precooked chicken breast strips did n't have the same dressing so just used a couple squirts of the o&v that i ha d & a touch of minced garlic . i added a small can of mushrooms at this point with most of the juice -lrb- did n't have broth -rrb- and a cup of minute brown rice -lrb- after microwaving -rrb- . i only used a couple spoonfuls of cream cheese though . enough to trick myself into thinking it was alfredo but less calories . -lrb- half fat -rrb- it totally worked !!! i seriously want to like the pan while it 's still hot !	1
This was a very good meal - tasted yummy as is and my family (husband and teenage daughter) really enjoyed it. However I'm only giving it 4 stars because it's not quite perfect. Next time I'll add more Italian dressing and/or chicken broth to make it a little more moist. I'd also like to try it with a little onion and some mushrooms - this is the perfect recipe for more veggies. I definitely recommend it and it's easy to tweak to your personal tastes.	this was a very good meal - tasted yummy as is and my family -lrb- husband and teenage daughter -rrb- really enjoyed it . however i 'm only giving it 4 stars because it 's not quite perfect . next time i 'll add mor e italian dressing and/or chicken broth to make it a little more moist . i 'd also like to try it with a little onion and some mushrooms - this is the perfect recipe for more veggies . i definitely recom mend it and it 's easy to tweak to your personal tastes .	1
This recipe was wonderful although I did make changes. I diced the chicken and cooked it in 1/4 cup of the dressing. I added another 1/4 cup of the dressing to the broth too. I cooked 1 cup of brown rice in 2 cans of chicken broth and added it all to the pan. I added a can of basil garlic tomatoes and no spinach but I did throw in a can of sliced mushrooms.

Like the first reviewer I too replaced some of the green tomatoes with potatoes and I added a little bit of carrot for color too. I actually enjoyed the tartness the tomatoes brought to the soup but my supply was limited and I'll admit this recipe made me nervous and I didn't want to use my entire stash of tomatoes. That is the only reason I subbed potatoes for some of the tomatoes. I have no regrets there either because they were a nice addition. The one complaint I have about this recipe is using all of the grease the 8 pieces of bacon yields. It gave the soup a rich bacon-y flavor yes but the end result was entirely too oily. I will definitely make this again next season when I can use the full amount of tomatoes but to be honest I will still add some potatoes. It needs the depth in my opinion.	like the first reviewer i too replaced some of the green tomatoes with potatoes and i added a little bit of carrot for color too . i actually enjoyed the tartness the tomatoes brought to the soup but m y supply was limited and i 'll admit this recipe made me nervous and i did n't want to use my entire stash of tomatoes . that is the only reason i subbed potatoes for some of the tomatoes . i have no regr ets there either because they were a nice addition . the one complaint i have about this recipe is using all of the grease the 8 pieces of bacon yields . it gave the soup a rich bacon-y flavor yes but t he end result was entirely too oily . i will definitely make this again next season when i can use the full amount of tomatoes but to be honest i will still add some potatoes . it needs the depth in my opinion .	1
I've wondered about using green tomatoes in soups before. I was surprised by the good flavor this soup had. With that said I knew 5 cups of green tomatoes would be too many for us. So I cut the amount of them to 2 cups and added 2 cups cubed potatoes instead. May have to add a little extra water to soup (as it cooks) if you use the potatoes. By cutting the amount of green tomatoes made it spot-on for us. I'm thinking about pureeing the cooked green tomatoes before adding any bacon next time. Good recipe if you want to try something interesting for a change and use up some left-over produce. Update: I forgot to mention that I rendered out fat in my bacon and then added to cooking soup I got the flavor but not so much of the fat.	i 've wondered about using green tomatoes in soups before . i was surprised by the good flavor this soup had . with that said i knew 5 cups of green tomatoes would be too many for us . so i cut the amount of them to 2 cups and added 2 cups cubed potatoes instead . may have to add a little extra water to soup -lrb- as it cooks -rrb- if you use the potatoes . by cutting the amount of green tomatoes made it spot-on for us . i 'm thinking about pureeing the cooked green tomatoes before adding any bacon next time . good recipe if you want to try something interesting for a change and use up some left-over produce . up date : i forgot to mention that i rendered out fat in my bacon and then added to cooking soup i got the flavor but not so much of the fat .	1

I'd made the Green Tomato Casserole recipe on this site and while it was tasty the texture was way too soupy and the shredded cheese most people recommended adding didn't melt right. (Probably bc of all the acid in the tomatoes.) So I used five heaping cups of THAT for the five cups of green tomatoes called for in this recipe. (The casserole had celery and onions as well -- I used Vidalias rather than green. The casserole has you cover the toms/onions/celery in a whisk of 1/4 c olive oil 2 T brown sugar 5 T soy black pepper red pepper flakes.) I think it was the soy/brown sugar/red pepper flakes -- and how they mixed w/ the liquid in the toms to make a rich sauce/gravy -- that added a richness and depth to the soup that made it so yummy. Like others I added a large potato and that too added some creaminess and depth. I also put some red toms in for added color but the flavor was lovely as well.

This sauce goes by many names, including Sunday sauce, since that's the day it's traditionally made, but for me growing up, this was just called 'sauce.'

There aren't a lot of great uses for leftover pickle juice.

While not identical to a pan-fried, breaded cutlet, if you want to eat tender, flavorful chicken with lots of crispy, crunchy bits, then this significantly less-messy method is for you. One of the keys to this technique is to use panko breadcrumbs, which are much larger and more jagged than regular, fine breadcrumbs. This method also allows us to introduce some additional flavor, and moisture, thanks to the 'glue' we use to attach the crumbs.	while not identical to a pan-fried , breaded cutlet , if you want to eat tender , flavorful chicken with lots of crispy , crunchy bits , then this significantly less-messy method is for you . one of the key s to this technique is to use panko breadcrumbs , which are much larger and more jagged than regular , fine breadcrumbs . this method also allows us to introduce some additional flavor , and moisture , tha nks to the ` glue ' we use to attach the crumbs .	1

These colors don't run, but they do stain, so I recommend eating this delicious, red, white and blueberry chicken outdoors at a barbeque. Smoky, spicy meats have been paired with sweet-and-sour, fruit-based sauces since we've had cooks, so that this combo works beautifully is no big surprise. And yes, other juicy fruit like peaches, or other berries will work nicely.	these colors do n't run , but they do stain , so i recommend eating this delicious , red , white and blueberry chicken outdoors at a barbeque . smoky , spicy meats have been paired with sweet-and-sour , fruit - based sauces since we 've had cooks , so that this combo works beautifully is no big surprise . and yes , other juicy fruit like peaches , or other berries will work nicely .	1
An extremely delicious meal: the crunch of pine nuts and the tang of sun-dried tomatoes combine with chicken and pasta in a heavenly pesto cream sauce. Be sure to taste and salt before serving, because depending on what kind of chicken broth you use, the dish may require no salt at all or may be extremely under-salted.	an extremely delicious meal : the crunch of pine nuts and the tang of sun-dried tomatoes combine with chicken and pasta in a heavenly pesto cream sauce . be sure to taste and salt before serving , becaus e depending on what kind of chicken broth you use , the dish may require no salt at all or may be extremely under-salted .	1

This pie does not sound very appetizing, but it is very good.  To me it tastes like pumpkin pie.

When it comes to mustard, sweet-hot works amazingly well, especially as a glaze for chicken. Even though we are using skin-on bone-in chicken thighs, I'm sure it will work with any cut of chicken. By the time this is done, it doesn't have a super-strong mustard flavor. It gets mellowed out by the brown sugar and spices. The old saying 'The closer the bone, the sweeter the meat' really is true. Leaving in the bones adds a lot of flavor and juiciness.	when it comes to mustard , sweet-hot works amazingly well , especially as a glaze for chicken . even though we are using skin-on bone-in chicken thighs , i 'm sure it will work with any cut of chicken . by the time this is done , it does n't have a super-strong mustard flavor . it gets mellowed out by the brown sugar and spices . the old saying ` the closer the bone , the sweeter the meat ' really is true . lea ving in the bones adds a lot of flavor and juiciness .	1
