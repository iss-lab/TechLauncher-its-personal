"I was hesitant because I always cook from scratch. But I've had so much trouble lately with  getting my chocolate cakes moist because of the high altitude I'm at, so I'll try anything. It turned out perfect. I cooked it in 9"" cake pans for a birthday cake filled it with raspberry & frosted with chocolate buttercream. Everyone raved about it, and it was so moist. I used the mini chocolate chips and they were perfect, melted totally. My husband said it was almost like a brownie cake. Great for decorating because it holds it shape and doesn't crumble. It will be my standard chocolate cake recipe, can't wait to try it again with different fillings and frostings. Yum!!!"	i was hesitant because i always cook from scratch . but i 've had so much trouble lately with getting my chocolate cakes moist because of the high altitude i 'm at , so i 'll try anything . it turned out p erfect . i cooked it in 9 '' cake pans for a birthday cake filled it with raspberry & frosted with chocolate buttercream . everyone raved about it , and it was so moist . i used the mini chocolate chips and they were perfect , melted totally . my husband said it was almost like a brownie cake . great for decorating because it holds it shape and does n't crumble . it will be my standard chocolate cake recipe , ca n't wait to try it again with different fillings and frostings . yum !!!	1
I had to make a second cake.  The recipe has too much oil and would not cook completely without the outside being overdone.  Cooked it again with 1/2 the oil and it was great.	i had to make a second cake . the recipe has too much oil and would not cook completely without the outside being overdone . cooked it again with 1/2 the oil and it was great .	1
"Thanks for posting this recipe, Denise.  It's a keeper for me.  I can say that for me, it is just almost too much chocolate cake.  I love that this cake is guaranteed to rise and have a fine texture due to the cake and pudding mixes yet it is lifted from being 'just a cake mix' by the addition of sour cream and the chocolate chips.

I found this cake very easy to make and it was a blessing in disguise that the top of the cake rose above the rim of my tin.  When the cake cooled, I was able to cut a perfectly flat base for the cake.. and thus sample the cake warm.  It was bliss when eaten with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce.

I followed reccommendations of other reviewers by cutting the oil to 1/2 cup, adding 1/3 cup milk and cutting back the chocolate chips to about 1 1/4 cups, or a large bag of chocolate chips in Australian brands.

I agree that this cake is enough without a glaze, but as I'm making this for a birthday (mine!!) - I will be topping it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this website.

This is a great recipe to have when you need a special cake quickly and with the minimum of fuss.

Two thumbs up!  I am sure the chocoholics in my family will polish this up tonight."	thanks for posting this recipe , denise . it 's a keeper for me . i can say that for me , it is just almost too much chocolate cake . i love that this cake is guaranteed to rise and have a fine texture d ue to the cake and pudding mixes yet it is lifted from being ` just a cake mix ' by the addition of sour cream and the chocolate chips . i found this cake very easy to make and it was a blessing in disg uise that the top of the cake rose above the rim of my tin . when the cake cooled , i was able to cut a perfectly flat base for the cake . . and thus sample the cake warm . it was bliss when eaten with v anilla ice cream and chocolate sauce . i followed reccommendations of other reviewers by cutting the oil to 1/2 cup , adding 1/3 cup milk and cutting back the chocolate chips to about 1 1/4 cups , or a large bag of chocolate chips in australian brands . i agree that this cake is enough without a glaze , but as i 'm making this for a birthday -lrb- mine !! -rrb- - i will be topping it with the satiny chocolate gl aze from this website . this is a great recipe to have when you need a special cake quickly and with the minimum of fuss . two thumbs up ! i am sure the chocoholics in my family will polish this up to night .	1
I've done quite a lot of baking in my life, which has included more cakes than I could count. This chocolate cake is one of the best I've ever made. Moist, fragrant,dark and with a rich chocolate flavor. It will become a classic go-to recipe for me. No reason to search for a better chocolate cake.	i 've done quite a lot of baking in my life , which has included more cakes than i could count . this chocolate cake is one of the best i 've ever made . moist , fragrant , dark and with a rich chocolate flav or . it will become a classic go-to recipe for me . no reason to search for a better chocolate cake .	1
"For those who had problems with the cake rising, I found this explanation of Dutch process cocoa which can make difference in the results: 
When it comes to baking, be sure to use the type of cocoa specified in the recipe. Those that are leavened with baking soda require natural (non-Dutch processed) cocoa so that the alkalinity of the baking soda can neutralize the acidic cocoa. Recipes leavened with baking powder require Dutch-process cocoa to maintain the neutral pH of both.
I used parchment paper in the bottom of the cake pan and up the sides to lift out the cake (8x8pan). The rest I made as cupcakes. The cupcakes cooked more evenly in less time.

This cake is so so moist and tasty. I frosted the cake with yellow frosting (I used food coloring) and then made black sugar bats all over the cake. I have a bat cookie cutter so I placed it on the cake in several postions and sprinkled black sugar within the cutter. I used little round red candies for the eyes. It looks like black bats flying in front of a full moon!	this cake is so so moist and tasty . i frosted the cake with yellow frosting -lrb- i used food coloring -rrb- and then made black sugar bats all over the cake . i have a bat cookie cutter so i placed it on the ca ke in several postions and sprinkled black sugar within the cutter . i used little round red candies for the eyes . it looks like black bats flying in front of a full moon !	1

This cake is delicious and simple to make! Two tips:#1: Have your frosting ingredients set out and ready to go. After stirring in the powdered sugar DO work quickly to spread it on the cake. It does become like fudge consistency as it cools. #2 If you have not checked to see how level your oven is you may want to do that before you start. An unlevel surface does show alot on a sheet cake. Wonderful recipe!! You won't be disappointed!!

a little slice of heaven! super easy for a whole lotta folks! it never fails that folks call this brownies. it's that rich in a way but much more decadent and frankly I can eat more of this than brownies any day of the week!

Needs more chocolate flavor. It was ok otherwise. Will not make as written again. I would start with 7 T of cocoa powder for cake and frosting use buttermilk in the frosting and maybe try coffee for replacement of the water.	needs more chocolate flavor . it was ok otherwise . will not make as written again . i would start with 7 t of cocoa powder for cake and frosting use buttermilk in the frosting and maybe try coffee for r eplacement of the water .	1
"AMAZING!  Make this and you will look like a pro!
My suggestions:
1) use 4x as much instant coffee powder in cake batter, and make 2 layers of coffee flavored cake
2)  i followed another reviewer's suggestion for substituting mascarpone with a mix of cream cheese, sour cream, and heavy cream, and it tastes great and is cheaper
3)  you must turn the cake upside down when layering, otherwise coffee liqueur will not soak into it
4)  i used kahlua for liqueur
5)  I used Duncan Hines supreme white cake mix-it is moist and uses egg whites
6)  i used a very strong espresso instead of the coffee to give it more flavor...also, instead of making coffee/espresso, just add water to some of the instant coffee powder, it tastes just fine in the cake"	amazing ! make this and you will look like a pro ! my suggestions : 1 -rrb- use 4 x as much instant coffee powder in cake batter , and make 2 layers of coffee flavored cake 2 -rrb- i followed another reviewer 's su ggestion for substituting mascarpone with a mix of cream cheese , sour cream , and heavy cream , and it tastes great and is cheaper 3 -rrb- you must turn the cake upside down when layering , otherwise coffee liqueur will not soak into it 4 -rrb- i used kahlua for liqueur 5 -rrb- i used duncan hines supreme white cake mix-it is moist and uses egg whites 6 -rrb- i used a very strong espresso instead of the coffee to gi ve it more flavor ... also , instead of making coffee/espresso , just add water to some of the instant coffee powder , it tastes just fine in the cake	1
Used 1 cup of coffee and 3T of liqueur. Made it twice this way and it turns out so wonderfly moist and flavorful. Oddly the coffee flavor is still very subtle. The cake layers are so moist with the extra liquid it is best to freeze them before you layer them.This way they will not fall apart when stacking.	used 1 cup of coffee and 3 t of liqueur . made it twice this way and it turns out so wonderfly moist and flavorful . oddly the coffee flavor is still very subtle . the cake layers are so moist with the ex tra liquid it is best to freeze them before you layer them.this way they will not fall apart when stacking .	1
Excellent. To make things easier, I used only 2 pans.  I poured half of the cake batter onto 1 deep pan and used a cake slicer to evenly divide it.  I followed the instructions to detail afterward.  Follow these tips for outstanding results: 1. Instead of mixing the instant coffee into the batter, mix 1/4 cup of water with about 1 tbsp of instant cofee powder and mix into the batter.  It tastes like an awesome mocha cake. 2. Also, be generous with the coffee mixture as you're pouring it over your cakes, that way the cake is MOIST.  Don't overdo it though! 3. Buy your MASCARPONE CHEESE at Trader Joes or Sams Club (even cheaper)...it's significantly cheaper there than any other grocery store that I went to. Excellent recipe!! thank you.	excellent . to make things easier , i used only 2 pans . i poured half of the cake batter onto 1 deep pan and used a cake slicer to evenly divide it . i followed the instructions to detail afterward . f ollow these tips for outstanding results : 1 . instead of mixing the instant coffee into the batter , mix 1/4 cup of water with about 1 tbsp of instant cofee powder and mix into the batter . it tastes li ke an awesome mocha cake . 2 . also , be generous with the coffee mixture as you 're pouring it over your cakes , that way the cake is moist . do n't overdo it though ! 3 . buy your mascarpone cheese at trade r joes or sams club -lrb- even cheaper -rrb- ... it 's significantly cheaper there than any other grocery store that i went to . excellent recipe !! thank you .	1
I thought that the cake and the filling recipes were wonderful. But when it was time to make the fristing, it turned out horrible. It was extremely watery and tasted sour. I decided to make a simple cream cheese combination frosting instead; and fortunately my cake was saved and everyone loved it. Can anyone tell me what I might have done wrong with the frosting?	i thought that the cake and the filling recipes were wonderful . but when it was time to make the fristing , it turned out horrible . it was extremely watery and tasted sour . i decided to make a simple c ream cheese combination frosting instead ; and fortunately my cake was saved and everyone loved it . can anyone tell me what i might have done wrong with the frosting ?	1
Absolutely delicious!  So easy to make with a beautiful finished outcome.  My whole family adored it and I've made it twice so far.  One note - if you want luscious chocolate curls don't use a square of baking chocolate.  Melt chocolate chips and shortening, refrigerate in a sm. rectangular pan, and shave away.

I made one change based on an old tradition that was passed on to me; instead of using boiling water I used freshly brewed hot coffee.  The cake was the best thing I have tasted and it stayed fresh and moist in a cake keeper for a full week.  I used a silicone bundt pan rather than round pans.	i made one change based on an old tradition that was passed on to me ; instead of using boiling water i used freshly brewed hot coffee . the cake was the best thing i have tasted and it stayed fresh an d moist in a cake keeper for a full week . i used a silicone bundt pan rather than round pans .	1

Wow,very tasty! I LOVE the frosting!!!  I use the frosting on my home made ice cream cakes since it is so thick and holds up very well! I have also made this recipe into an ice cream cake and it worked wonderfully. Just remember not to overbake it. For an ice cream cake, pour batter into 2 identical springform pans. Bake as directed, coolcompletely, then slice in half horizontally so you have 4 cake layers. Then place the bottomlayer back in the springform pan, top with softened ice cream, anotherlayer ofcake, more ice cream, another cake, more ice cream, then cake! Takes about a half gallon of ice cream. Freeze completely, prob overnight, open sides of pan. Then I ice a thin layer, put back in freezer for an hour or so, then frostcake as usual! Store in freezer until right before serving! It's been a hit several times over!	wow , very tasty ! i love the frosting !!! i use the frosting on my home made ice cream cakes since it is so thick and holds up very well ! i have also made this recipe into an ice cream cake and it worke d wonderfully . just remember not to overbake it . for an ice cream cake , pour batter into 2 identical springform pans . bake as directed , coolcompletely , then slice in half horizontally so you have 4 ca ke layers . then place the bottomlayer back in the springform pan , top with softened ice cream , anotherlayer ofcake , more ice cream , another cake , more ice cream , then cake ! takes about a half gallon o f ice cream . freeze completely , prob overnight , open sides of pan . then i ice a thin layer , put back in freezer for an hour or so , then frostcake as usual ! store in freezer until right before serving ! it 's been a hit several times over !	1

I am a pastry chef, and this is the only chocolate cake that I will make from now on.  I separated the eggs and whipped the whites separately with some of the sugar, then folded it all together to make is extra airy.  This recipe could easily be flavored with coffee, juice, or buttermilk in place of the water.

I get tired of my usual choc. cake recipes so am always looking for something new. This is a very good cake. I made it in a 12 cup bundt pan but other than that followed the recipe exactly and found it to be sweet enough with a good chocolate flavor and I had no problem with the cake falling apart. For those who thought it was dry: make sure the cocoa-boiling water mixture has cooled thoroughly before proceeding with the recipe otherwise the cake may turn out heavy and dry.	i get tired of my usual choc . cake recipes so am always looking for something new . this is a very good cake . i made it in a 12 cup bundt pan but other than that followed the recipe exactly and found i t to be sweet enough with a good chocolate flavor and i had no problem with the cake falling apart . for those who thought it was dry : make sure the cocoa-boiling water mixture has cooled thoroughly be fore proceeding with the recipe otherwise the cake may turn out heavy and dry .	1
Quite disappointing after all the excellent reviews. Like many I've been searching for 'the' chocolate cake recipe and this is not it. I'm going to stick to oil as my search continues -- the butter-based chocolate cake recipes I've tried resulted to rubbery textures and oil-based ones consistently give better results. (If anyone knows the explanation or better yet the solution to this it will be much appreciated!)	quite disappointing after all the excellent reviews . like many i 've been searching for ` the ' chocolate cake recipe and this is not it . i 'm going to stick to oil as my search continues -- the butter-ba sed chocolate cake recipes i 've tried resulted to rubbery textures and oil-based ones consistently give better results . -lrb- if anyone knows the explanation or better yet the solution to this it will be m uch appreciated ! -rrb-	1
I made this cake for the first time yesterday and it came out really moist and delicious. I used coffee instead of water as suggested and I cooked the cake in 2 pans and cut each cake into 2 layers. I used whipped ganache with rum as filling and i decorated the cake with fresh berries.

"When I want chocolate cake, nine times out of ten, this is the cake I make.  Whether eaten plain, or my favourite way, which is sandwiched with dulce de leche and topped with chocolate ganache, it's brilliant!  One little thing though:  the directions are fine if you want to serve your cake in the pan, but if you want to unmould it for prettier presentation, your pan will need to be greased and floured, or brushed with bakers' secret (which is no secret: combine equal parts oil, shortening, and flour).  This means you should mix the cake in a separate bowl, but hey, it's still really easy and cleanup is minimal.

Now!  For all you people nervous about the vinegar:  there is a simple reason why it's there.  For a cake to rise, you need an alkali, and an acid.  When the alkali and the acid combine, they react with each other, giving off carbon dioxide, which is what makes the cake rise.  All cakes other than yeast cakes are risen this way.  The alkali/acid deal is present in baking powder (already mixed for you), and in recipes that call for baking soda (alkali) and, say, cream of tartar (acid).  In this case, you have baking soda (alkali) and vinegar (acid).  They react with each other and make the cake rise.  You CANNOT taste the vinegar, so relax, make the cake, and enjoy!"	when i want chocolate cake , nine times out of ten , this is the cake i make . whether eaten plain , or my favourite way , which is sandwiched with dulce de leche and topped with chocolate ganache , it 's b rilliant ! one little thing though : the directions are fine if you want to serve your cake in the pan , but if you want to unmould it for prettier presentation , your pan will need to be greased and fl oured , or brushed with bakers ' secret -lrb- which is no secret : combine equal parts oil , shortening , and flour -rrb- . this means you should mix the cake in a separate bowl , but hey , it 's still really easy and cleanup is minimal . now ! for all you people nervous about the vinegar : there is a simple reason why it 's there . for a cake to rise , you need an alkali , and an acid . when the alkali and the acid combine , they react with each other , giving off carbon dioxide , which is what makes the cake rise . all cakes other than yeast cakes are risen this way . the alkali/acid deal is present in baking pow der -lrb- already mixed for you -rrb- , and in recipes that call for baking soda -lrb- alkali -rrb- and , say , cream of tartar -lrb- acid -rrb- . in this case , you have baking soda -lrb- alkali -rrb- and vinegar -lrb- acid -rrb- . they react with each other and make the cake rise . you can not taste the vinegar , so relax , make the cake , and enjoy !	2

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! I was also worried about the vinegar in the cake so I very tenatively tasted the batter...couldn't taste a bit of it. I am a total chocolate fiend and have been placed on a special diet where I can't have any dairy products I know what a chocolate cake should taste like and I was not disappointed in the least. I will most likely continue to make this recipe even after I can eat normal foods again!

I made this as a birthday cake and it turned out wonderful. Just rich enough without being too rich very moist without falling apart. Used cool whip as a topping as the cake is fabulous enough without a frosting. Only changes I made was adding a little cardamom to the batter and I omitted the liqueur this time (but will definitely try it next time.) Will definitely make this cake again.	i made this as a birthday cake and it turned out wonderful . just rich enough without being too rich very moist without falling apart . used cool whip as a topping as the cake is fabulous enough without a frosting . only changes i made was adding a little cardamom to the batter and i omitted the liqueur this time -lrb- but will definitely try it next time . -rrb- will definitely make this cake again .	1
I barely made any changes to the actual cake portion of this recipe but did use 1/4 cup applesauce in addition to cup oil instead of a full cup of oil. I also used half of Hershey s Dark cocoa as well as regular unsweetened cocoa. Using the cake as a base I added the following loosely following another recipe: Once cake cooled I poked holes into each cake using a long tined fork then poured a mix of cherry juice and slight amount of brandy onto each cake. Then I used a mix of.5 cup creamed butter.3 cup of /granulated sugar and almond extract to make a buttercream filling and put a layer on one of the cakes. I put one can of cherry pie filling (excluding juice) on that same cake then topped with slightly sweetened heavy whipping cream. I put the other cake on top then laid another can of cherry pie filling sans juice on top followed with more whipped cream. I used 2 cups of liquid heavy whipping cream when I made the cream for the middle and top of cake which was perfect. I had one slice right away and while it was good thought it was missing something but didn t know what. The cherries were somehow boring as well. The next day somehow it was wonderful! It was very moist and the flavors were enhanced. I originally thought the buttercream was a waste of time; however each day that passes (day 3 now) the filling flavor comes out more and really makes this cake! I will definitely use this recipe for any chocolate cakes I make from now on!	i barely made any changes to the actual cake portion of this recipe but did use 1/4 cup applesauce in addition to cup oil instead of a full cup of oil . i also used half of hershey s dark cocoa as well as regular unsweetened cocoa . using the cake as a base i added the following loosely following another recipe : once cake cooled i poked holes into each cake using a long tined fork then poured a mix of cherry juice and slight amount of brandy onto each cake . then i used a mix of .5 cup creamed butter .3 cup of / granulated sugar and almond extract to make a buttercream filling and put a layer on one of the cakes . i put one can of cherry pie filling -lrb- excluding juice -rrb- on that same cake then topped with slightly sweetened heavy whipping cream . i put the other cake on top then laid another can of ch erry pie filling sans juice on top followed with more whipped cream . i used 2 cups of liquid heavy whipping cream when i made the cream for the middle and top of cake which was perfect . i had one slic e right away and while it was good thought it was missing something but didn t know what . the cherries were somehow boring as well . the next day somehow it was wonderful ! it was very moist and the fla vors were enhanced . i originally thought the buttercream was a waste of time ; however each day that passes -lrb- day 3 now -rrb- the filling flavor comes out more and really makes this cake ! i will definitely u se this recipe for any chocolate cakes i make from now on !	1
This is excellent - beautiful results with relatively little work. I whipped up a big container of Rich's Whip and put it in between the two layers with the cherry filling and on top with a few cherries for garnishes. My company was impressed with the looks and loved the taste.	this is excellent - beautiful results with relatively little work . i whipped up a big container of rich 's whip and put it in between the two layers with the cherry filling and on top with a few cherri es for garnishes . my company was impressed with the looks and loved the taste .	1
Great recipe. I did not use the liqueur though. Instead I bought the canned cherry filling washed off the liquid in it and mixed the chopped cherries with some of the whipped cream and layered the cake with it after drizzling with the cherry syrup. then topped with whipped cream. It was a super hit.	great recipe . i did not use the liqueur though . instead i bought the canned cherry filling washed off the liquid in it and mixed the chopped cherries with some of the whipped cream and layered the cak e with it after drizzling with the cherry syrup . then topped with whipped cream . it was a super hit .	1

Just an update on my review from last year. The cake is still excellent and everyone still loves it but I wanted to let you know that it is also now a blue ribbon winner! I entered it in the chocolate cake category at our county fair. I frosted it with a vanilla powdered sugar frosting and it took FIRST place. Just thought you would like to know.

I made this cake for my friend's birthday party and I copied some of the changes that the other members suggested. I  cut the oil to 3/4 cup and added 3/4 cup of apple sauce. And instead of using all, all-purpose flour, I used 1 cup of all-purpose and 1 cup of whole wheat. I also cut the sugar in half because the applesauce is sweet so that would make up for some of the missing sugar and then I added a tsp of vanilla. Anyway, when I brought this cake to my friends birthday party, everybody raved about it! Even my friend who hates all vegetables and fruits LOVED it (she still doesn't know that it was a zucchini cake because I haven't told her yet). AWESOME cake :)	i made this cake for my friend 's birthday party and i copied some of the changes that the other members suggested . i cut the oil to 3/4 cup and added 3/4 cup of apple sauce . and instead of using all , all-purpose flour , i used 1 cup of all-purpose and 1 cup of whole wheat . i also cut the sugar in half because the applesauce is sweet so that would make up for some of the missing sugar and then i ad ded a tsp of vanilla . anyway , when i brought this cake to my friends birthday party , everybody raved about it ! even my friend who hates all vegetables and fruits loved it -lrb- she still does n't know that it was a zucchini cake because i have n't told her yet -rrb- . awesome cake :-rrb-	1
Don't make this cake before reading this review!!!! The cake was wonderful but please don't add 1 1/2 cups of oil! We all agreed that 1 cup was just right - too much more would have resulted in a dense greasy cake. No need to use applesauce for some of the oil either. This cake was perfectly moist with just 1 cup of oil. We also left out the nuts which was just fine. I used olive oil as I do with most of my baking and it was great. We all agreed the cake tasted better room temp the next day rather than warm out of the oven. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!	do n't make this cake before reading this review !!!! the cake was wonderful but please do n't add 1 1/2 cups of oil ! we all agreed that 1 cup was just right - too much more would have resulted in a dens e greasy cake . no need to use applesauce for some of the oil either . this cake was perfectly moist with just 1 cup of oil . we also left out the nuts which was just fine . i used olive oil as i do with most of my baking and it was great . we all agreed the cake tasted better room temp the next day rather than warm out of the oven . thanks for a wonderful recipe !	1
Great Cake!  and Easy to make too!  Great in bundt pan rather than 9x13 cake plan.  No icing required.	great cake ! and easy to make too ! great in bundt pan rather than 9 x13 cake plan . no icing required .	1
This cake was extremely moist; however it had a somewhat bitter flavor. Too much cocoa powder? I will try it again and use 2/3 cup rather than 3/4 cup cocoa.	this cake was extremely moist ; however it had a somewhat bitter flavor . too much cocoa powder ? i will try it again and use 2/3 cup rather than 3/4 cup cocoa .	1
I made 2 cakes. The 1st one wasn't very appealing but it tasted great. The 2nd one looked beautiful and tasted even better. What did I do different the 2nd time? I read the cheesecake techniques article found on this website. I wrapped foil around the bottom of my pan & placed the pan on a cookie sheet. Then I filled the cookie sheet w/water. I baked the cheesecake for an hour then turned the oven off & let the cheesecake sit in the oven for another hour. This prevents the cake from sinking in the middle. Everyone loved it! It was delicious and I can't wait to make it again.	i made 2 cakes . the 1 st one was n't very appealing but it tasted great . the 2 nd one looked beautiful and tasted even better . what did i do different the 2 nd time ? i read the cheesecake techniques artic le found on this website . i wrapped foil around the bottom of my pan & placed the pan on a cookie sheet . then i filled the cookie sheet w/water . i baked the cheesecake for an hour then turned the oven off & let the cheesecake sit in the oven for another hour . this prevents the cake from sinking in the middle . everyone loved it ! it was delicious and i ca n't wait to make it again .	1
This is SOOOOOOOOOOO delicious -- I've made it three times now, and it is already legendary within my extended family!  :-)  Just a couple of recommendations:  definitely double the amount of cookie crumbs used for the crust; one cup barely covers the bottom of the springform pan.  If you're using smashed up Oreos for your chocolate cookie crumbs (which is what I do), then you don't need anywhere near as much butter or sugar in the crust; the Oreo creamy filling provides lots of sweetness and stick-it-together-ness.  I use 2 cups crushed Oreos, only one tablespoon sugar, and 1/4 cup melted butter -- the crust comes out perfect that way.  Also, I'm not sure if I just have delinquently leaky springform pans or what, but the first time I made this, I ended up with melted butter dripping down from the bottom of the pan all over the bottom of my oven (quite a mess).  Now I put a jelly roll pan on the oven shelf below to catch the dripping butter, and all is well.  :-)  I have ended up with a few cracks in the top of the cheesecake each time I have made this, but once I pile on tons of white chocolate shavings/curls, no one is the wiser!  This cheesecake absolutely could NOT taste better -- people go CRAZY over it.	this is sooooooooooo delicious -- i 've made it three times now , and it is already legendary within my extended family ! :--rrb- just a couple of recommendations : definitely double the amount of cookie c rumbs used for the crust ; one cup barely covers the bottom of the springform pan . if you 're using smashed up oreos for your chocolate cookie crumbs -lrb- which is what i do -rrb- , then you do n't need anywhere near as much butter or sugar in the crust ; the oreo creamy filling provides lots of sweetness and stick-it-together-ness . i use 2 cups crushed oreos , only one tablespoon sugar , and 1/4 cup melted but ter -- the crust comes out perfect that way . also , i 'm not sure if i just have delinquently leaky springform pans or what , but the first time i made this , i ended up with melted butter dripping down from the bottom of the pan all over the bottom of my oven -lrb- quite a mess -rrb- . now i put a jelly roll pan on the oven shelf below to catch the dripping butter , and all is well . :--rrb- i have ended up with a few cracks in the top of the cheesecake each time i have made this , but once i pile on tons of white chocolate shavings/curls , no one is the wiser ! this cheesecake absolutely could not taste better -- people go crazy over it .	1
This is an EXCELLENT cheesecake! I made it for my family Christmas dinner and everyone just raved about it! I would not change a thing on this recipe! I plan to make it for New Year's Eve! A cheesecake tip when the cheesecake is almost done turn off your oven and open the oven door. Do not take it out until the oven and cheesecake are completely cool. This will avoid cracks.	this is an excellent cheesecake ! i made it for my family christmas dinner and everyone just raved about it ! i would not change a thing on this recipe ! i plan to make it for new year 's eve ! a cheesecak e tip when the cheesecake is almost done turn off your oven and open the oven door . do not take it out until the oven and cheesecake are completely cool . this will avoid cracks .	1
This is a great recipe--everyone I've served it to loved it. I use oreos for the crust. Put them in a ziplock bag and crush them with a meat mallet and rolling pin. Also blend the raspberries and water in the blender and strain the berries before you make the sauce much easier to get the seeds out. Save out a few raspberries to stir into the sauce that goes on top just before serving. Nice with a bit of white chocolate melted with a little bit of milk and drizzled on top.	this is a great recipe -- everyone i 've served it to loved it . i use oreos for the crust . put them in a ziplock bag and crush them with a meat mallet and rolling pin . also blend the raspberries and wate r in the blender and strain the berries before you make the sauce much easier to get the seeds out . save out a few raspberries to stir into the sauce that goes on top just before serving . nice with a bit of white chocolate melted with a little bit of milk and drizzled on top .	1
"My son and I made this cake for a friend whose favorite cake is German Chocolate.  He's a great cook himself, and so is VERY fussy about his food.  This cake turned out GREAT, and my friend was very complimentary of it!  Since a mixer part was missing in action, we did all the mixing and beating by hand, and it still turned out just fine.  It was very moist, had great shape and texture, and looked beautiful after adding the chocolate drizzle. 

The next time I make it, though, I will ADD TWO EXTRA OUNCES OF CHOCOLATE TO THE CAKE MIXTURE, to make it just a touch chocolate-ier.  Also, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE ONE AND A HALF RECIPES OF THE FILLING/FROSTING. One recipe of it would not be enough, and 1 1/2 is just right.  Also, TOAST THE COCONUT AND PECANS.  That makes them much, much better.  Be careful about burning the coconut.  It toasts very quickly.  A great cake that we will probably make a lot!  Well worth the trouble."	my son and i made this cake for a friend whose favorite cake is german chocolate . he 's a great cook himself , and so is very fussy about his food . this cake turned out great , and my friend was very c omplimentary of it ! since a mixer part was missing in action , we did all the mixing and beating by hand , and it still turned out just fine . it was very moist , had great shape and texture , and looked beautiful after adding the chocolate drizzle . the next time i make it , though , i will add two extra ounces of chocolate to the cake mixture , to make it just a touch chocolate-ier . also , it 's ver y important to make one and a half recipes of the filling/frosting . one recipe of it would not be enough , and 1 1/2 is just right . also , toast the coconut and pecans . that makes them much , much bett er . be careful about burning the coconut . it toasts very quickly . a great cake that we will probably make a lot ! well worth the trouble .	1
This cake was awesome.  I had a profesional baker make my wife a german chocolate cake for her birthday.  This cake tasted so much better than that one.  My wife loves german chcolate cake and she said is was the best she has ever eaten.  I dobled the icing it looks like alot when you make it, but it turned out just right.  Also I used a little more chocolate on the top of the cake.  I had to turn the heat up to get the icing to start boiling, but it turned out great.  I recomend this cake very highly.	this cake was awesome . i had a profesional baker make my wife a german chocolate cake for her birthday . this cake tasted so much better than that one . my wife loves german chcolate cake and she sai d is was the best she has ever eaten . i dobled the icing it looks like alot when you make it , but it turned out just right . also i used a little more chocolate on the top of the cake . i had to turn the heat up to get the icing to start boiling , but it turned out great . i recomend this cake very highly .	1
The recipe for German Chocolate Cake is on the bar of the Bakers German Chocolate Bar. Everything is the same except this recipe calls for 1/2 cup more flour(cake) and 1/4 teaspoon more salt. This recipe was ok not as moist flavorful or buttery as the recipe calling for 2 cups of flour. I did use cake flour recommended. I was quite disappointed and everyone said that my old recipe was so much better. i definitely agree. The chocolate color was not as intense (lighter brown) and cake tasted dry. I also toasted the pecans but I like the non toasted taste better for this cake. Will not try this recipe again but rather will stick by my old recipe. It is so much better. The frosting can be made the day before (used the recipe on the German chocolate bar). It is delicious ample enough to frost the entire cake.	the recipe for german chocolate cake is on the bar of the bakers german chocolate bar . everything is the same except this recipe calls for 1/2 cup more flour -lrb- cake -rrb- and 1/4 teaspoon more salt . this rec ipe was ok not as moist flavorful or buttery as the recipe calling for 2 cups of flour . i did use cake flour recommended . i was quite disappointed and everyone said that my old recipe was so much bett er . i definitely agree . the chocolate color was not as intense -lrb- lighter brown -rrb- and cake tasted dry . i also toasted the pecans but i like the non toasted taste better for this cake . will not try this r ecipe again but rather will stick by my old recipe . it is so much better . the frosting can be made the day before -lrb- used the recipe on the german chocolate bar -rrb- . it is delicious ample enough to frost t he entire cake .	1
"My boyfriend's mother is supposedly famous for this cake, and the first time I tried the infamous dessert, I laughed silently to myself knowing that I could out her secret and it's ease with a mere link. But I didn't. :)
I do however serve this cake, and it is one No one can get enough of. I use dark chocolate chunks as opposed to chocolate chips. Try using mini bundt pans, and make sure to dust them with a little cocoa...I prefer Ghirardelli. Serve them drizzled with a liqueur, and don't be afraid to experiment with flavors...this is the kind of dessert you can cater specially to the tastes of your guests. I have used raspberry, hazelnut and creme de menthe liqueurs, all with raving success. Garnish with a couple of mint leaves and you're set. It's so easy it's ridiculous.

*edit* I found these little Andes Mint mini chips at the grocer and used them in place of chocolate chips. Oh my goooood. So moist and minty, it was positively sinful!"	my boyfriend 's mother is supposedly famous for this cake , and the first time i tried the infamous dessert , i laughed silently to myself knowing that i could out her secret and it 's ease with a mere li nk . but i did n't . :-rrb- i do however serve this cake , and it is one no one can get enough of . i use dark chocolate chunks as opposed to chocolate chips . try using mini bundt pans , and make sure to dust t hem with a little cocoa ... i prefer ghirardelli . serve them drizzled with a liqueur , and do n't be afraid to experiment with flavors ... this is the kind of dessert you can cater specially to the tastes o f your guests . i have used raspberry , hazelnut and creme de menthe liqueurs , all with raving success . garnish with a couple of mint leaves and you 're set . it 's so easy it 's ridiculous . * edit * i found these little andes mint mini chips at the grocer and used them in place of chocolate chips . oh my goooood . so moist and minty , it was positively sinful !	2
Yes this is a very rich sweet moist dense cake. Made this about 4 times and second time decreased chocolate chips to 1 cup which is plenty sweet and taste better. I also used 1 cup of Irish cream flavored liquer which tastes much better and added more flavor. Have also substituted 2 tablespoon instant espresso powder in place of the liquer and was fantastic. Espresso really brings out the flavor of chocolate. Have also used Andes Mint Chocolate baking chips and it was to die for! Also use room temp. eggs which makes cake rise better. (If in a pinch soak cold eggs in very hot tap water for 5 min.) No need for glaze or frosting or this will be too sweet. Taste best with fresh strawberries/rasberries if available. If not dust with powdered sugar and you're good to go. So easy and taste very homemade!! TIP - You can use other cake mix flavors such as Vanilla and add the sour cream to make a moist dense yellow cake.	yes this is a very rich sweet moist dense cake . made this about 4 times and second time decreased chocolate chips to 1 cup which is plenty sweet and taste better . i also used 1 cup of irish cream flav ored liquer which tastes much better and added more flavor . have also substituted 2 tablespoon instant espresso powder in place of the liquer and was fantastic . espresso really brings out the flavor o f chocolate . have also used andes mint chocolate baking chips and it was to die for ! also use room temp . eggs which makes cake rise better . -lrb- if in a pinch soak cold eggs in very hot tap water for 5 mi n. -rrb- no need for glaze or frosting or this will be too sweet . taste best with fresh strawberries/rasberries if available . if not dust with powdered sugar and you 're good to go . so easy and taste very h omemade !! tip - you can use other cake mix flavors such as vanilla and add the sour cream to make a moist dense yellow cake .	1
This cake is a Chocoholic's Dream! You'd really never know it was a boxed cake - it's that good! It's very dense moist rich and chocolately - what more could you ask for from such a simple recipe! You really don't even need frosting just a dusting of confectioners' sugar which provided a nice contrast and didn't ruin the flavor. I did cut back of the chocolate chips using only 1 cup. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing! This cake is perfect when you don't have time to make a scratch cake but want something that tastes like you did!	this cake is a chocoholic 's dream ! you 'd really never know it was a boxed cake - it 's that good ! it 's very dense moist rich and chocolately - what more could you ask for from such a simple recipe ! you really do n't even need frosting just a dusting of confectioners ' sugar which provided a nice contrast and did n't ruin the flavor . i did cut back of the chocolate chips using only 1 cup . other than th at i would n't change a thing ! this cake is perfect when you do n't have time to make a scratch cake but want something that tastes like you did !	1
Incredible cake! I almost break out in hives at the thought of baking a BOXED cake...but I must give credit where it is due. I tried using one cup of chocolate chips at the suggestion of other reviewers and it's delicious. I prefer using the full 2 cups of mini chocolate chips though. I think it lends greatly to the gooey consistancy of the cake. Regular chocolate chips look like chips in cake...the minis seem to melt right in. I have also experimented with different liquors such as Kahlua and Godiva but try others for fun too. I think it's great with Bailey's which my husband liked but when I used my Aramula cream liqueur...he declared it the best chocolate cake in the world. It needs no icing...try a light dusting of powdered sugar for asthetics. Make sure you dust just before serving. This cake is so moist...the powdered sugar is quickly absorbed (and may look less than appealing). Also make sure you do flour the pan or use baker's joy. Once I only used oil and the cake didnt fall out as neatly.	incredible cake ! i almost break out in hives at the thought of baking a boxed cake ... but i must give credit where it is due . i tried using one cup of chocolate chips at the suggestion of other reviewe rs and it 's delicious . i prefer using the full 2 cups of mini chocolate chips though . i think it lends greatly to the gooey consistancy of the cake . regular chocolate chips look like chips in cake ... t he minis seem to melt right in . i have also experimented with different liquors such as kahlua and godiva but try others for fun too . i think it 's great with bailey 's which my husband liked but when i used my aramula cream liqueur ... he declared it the best chocolate cake in the world . it needs no icing ... try a light dusting of powdered sugar for asthetics . make sure you dust just before serving . t his cake is so moist ... the powdered sugar is quickly absorbed -lrb- and may look less than appealing -rrb- . also make sure you do flour the pan or use baker 's joy . once i only used oil and the cake didnt fall o ut as neatly .	1

This cake is incredible. I have tried for a very long time to find a recipe like this one. It is moist and full of flavour. The first time I baked this cake I followed the recipe exactly and the cake turned out wonderful. The second time I used milk instead of the liquer and topped it with a chocolate ganache glaze since I love a rich chocolate cake. This cake has made the Allrecipe website my favourite one.	this cake is incredible . i have tried for a very long time to find a recipe like this one . it is moist and full of flavour . the first time i baked this cake i followed the recipe exactly and the cake turned out wonderful . the second time i used milk instead of the liquer and topped it with a chocolate ganache glaze since i love a rich chocolate cake . this cake has made the allrecipe website my fav ourite one .	1
This cake was just okay for me. I'd say it definitely needs a frosting or a glaze to come close to the expectations raised by the recipe description and reviews. It really just tasted like a souped-up box cake... one with a little something added to it but a box cake nonetheless. I'd give it three stars but after all the ecstatic reviews I was pretty disappointed. I won't be making this again.	this cake was just okay for me . i 'd say it definitely needs a frosting or a glaze to come close to the expectations raised by the recipe description and reviews . it really just tasted like a souped-up box cake ... one with a little something added to it but a box cake nonetheless . i 'd give it three stars but after all the ecstatic reviews i was pretty disappointed . i wo n't be making this again .	1
My original review was 4 stars because I tried the cake only a few hours after baking.  The cake alone was OK but had a strong baking soda taste.  I used a can of dunkin hines vanilla frosting and with this the cake was good.  However, after mellowing in the fridge for a day or two this cake was insanely good!  As good as any store bought or boxed mix.  Bottom line:  Make the cake a day in advance and let it mellow in the fridge overnight.  I see no need to buy another boxed mix again.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Oh, and yes, after the water step it will be very soupy but it will turn out perfect :D	my original review was 4 stars because i tried the cake only a few hours after baking . the cake alone was ok but had a strong baking soda taste . i used a can of dunkin hines vanilla frosting and wit h this the cake was good . however , after mellowing in the fridge for a day or two this cake was insanely good ! as good as any store bought or boxed mix . bottom line : make the cake a day in advance and let it mellow in the fridge overnight . i see no need to buy another boxed mix again . thanks for a great recipe . oh , and yes , after the water step it will be very soupy but it will turn out per fect :d	1

"This cake will be printed out as my new basic chocolate cake. Everything about it was nice, I did add a teaspoon of instant coffee to the boiling water and the batter was thin. Baked up perfect - I did line the tin and use oil spray. Tastes better than some expensive box mixes. Wasn't overly moist either, just not dry at all. Thanks.
UPDATE: Up the amount of cocoa to 1 cup and make sure it's the best quality. I use a European brand. You can use melted butter if you run out of oil. You can use whipped cream, cocoa powder and icing sugar for a great icing."	this cake will be printed out as my new basic chocolate cake . everything about it was nice , i did add a teaspoon of instant coffee to the boiling water and the batter was thin . baked up perfect - i di d line the tin and use oil spray . tastes better than some expensive box mixes . was n't overly moist either , just not dry at all . thanks . update : up the amount of cocoa to 1 cup and make sure it 's the b est quality . i use a european brand . you can use melted butter if you run out of oil . you can use whipped cream , cocoa powder and icing sugar for a great icing .	1

Absolutely delicious and so EASY to make!  We made this for a birthday party just last weekend and made another one last night for ourselves.  Perfect with some whipped topping, we added a 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips to make it even more chocolatey!  If you do this, make sure to sprinkle it on top of the batter AFTER you have poured it into the baking pan, let them just sit on the top.  Since the batter is thin, mixing them in will cause them to sink to the bottom and stick to the pan as you try to get the cake out.	absolutely delicious and so easy to make ! we made this for a birthday party just last weekend and made another one last night for ourselves . perfect with some whipped topping , we added a 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips to make it even more chocolatey ! if you do this , make sure to sprinkle it on top of the batter after you have poured it into the baking pan , let them just sit on the top . since the batter is thin , mixing them in will cause them to sink to the bottom and stick to the pan as you try to get the cake out .	1
This is not a good cake to make a layer cake with.  It is delicious, but it is more of a pudding cake, or a spoon type cake.  It would NOT come out of the pans, even though the pans were well greased before hand.  This cake came out in chunks...the kids had a great time eating the scraps, but we had to start over for my daughter's birthday cake.	this is not a good cake to make a layer cake with . it is delicious , but it is more of a pudding cake , or a spoon type cake . it would not come out of the pans , even though the pans were well greased before hand . this cake came out in chunks ... the kids had a great time eating the scraps , but we had to start over for my daughter 's birthday cake .	1

Uh, this is RIDICULOUS...  Ridiculously  fantastic!  For a point of reference, I have been buying the Trader Joe's flourless chocolate cake... this recipe is just as good if not better! I substituted 1/3C egg whites for two of the four eggs.  I also used  1/2 C milk chocolate chips and 1 C. semi sweet chips, and dusted the pan with unsweetened coco pwdr.  I have a gluten intolerance and only use Ghiradelli as Hershey's is difficult to get an answer about allergies.

This cake is the most delicious and decedent chocolate cake I have ever tasted! For all those reviewers who are giving this recipe 1/5 stars, you must NOT be following the recipe correctly.  It actually upsets me reading the negative reviews.  How is possible to be biting into a bean? You are supposed to be blending the beans into a smooth mixture via a food processor! How is it dry? The recipe calls for 4 eggs! Grainy? Again, mix via food processor to a smooth consistency and wash the beans thoroughly beforehand.  Not sweet enough or chocolately enough? Are you using the correct measuring spoons?! Anyone who follows this recipe to the exact T should be successful in making a delicious cake.  If you have a good quality food processor, a non stick baking pan, and you know how to read and follow instructions, this cake will turn out fantastic.

I made this cake out of plain curiosity in my search for healthy deserts - it was so much better than i had ever imagined! Garbanzo beans...who would have thought? I covered the cake with strawberries and sifted powdered sugar - it was a hit! I think the strawberries gave the cake the sugar/sweetness that a frosting would have normally - next time i will try out different fruits :)	i made this cake out of plain curiosity in my search for healthy deserts - it was so much better than i had ever imagined ! garbanzo beans ... who would have thought ? i covered the cake with strawberries and sifted powdered sugar - it was a hit ! i think the strawberries gave the cake the sugar/sweetness that a frosting would have normally - next time i will try out different fruits :-rrb-	1
I have made the chocolate version several times and love it. Even non-Celiacs in the family love it and it is realitively healthy since there is no butter or oil in it. I have also made my own COCONUT version of this cake. To make a coconut version: 1)Omit the chocolate chips. 2)Add one can of coconut milk. 3) Add a bag of dried coconut. 3) Increase the sugar from 3/4 cup to 1 1/4 cups. 4) Add 1/4 tsp of salt. 6) 1 tsp of vanilla. 5)I like to top it with coconut frosting from the baking aisle of the store.	i have made the chocolate version several times and love it . even non-celiacs in the family love it and it is realitively healthy since there is no butter or oil in it . i have also made my own coconut version of this cake . to make a coconut version : 1 -rrb- omit the chocolate chips . 2 -rrb- add one can of coconut milk . 3 -rrb- add a bag of dried coconut . 3 -rrb- increase the sugar from 3/4 cup to 1 1/4 cups . 4 -rrb- add 1/4 tsp of salt . 6 -rrb- 1 tsp of vanilla . 5 -rrb- i like to top it with coconut frosting from the baking aisle of the store .	1
I think that my expectations were a little too high for this recipe; I have just started to try out gluten-free cooking and products.  I didn't have very high hopes for baked goods without gluten, but when I read all the great reviews for this recipe, I thought I should try it.  I followed the recipe exactly, and I felt like it was lacking something; the texture was fine, but it wasn't sweet enough or rich enough or...something.  I won't make this one again, and I'll keep looking for other recipes for gluten-free deserts.	i think that my expectations were a little too high for this recipe ; i have just started to try out gluten-free cooking and products . i did n't have very high hopes for baked goods without gluten , but when i read all the great reviews for this recipe , i thought i should try it . i followed the recipe exactly , and i felt like it was lacking something ; the texture was fine , but it was n't sweet enoug h or rich enough or ... something . i wo n't make this one again , and i 'll keep looking for other recipes for gluten-free deserts .	1
I made this recipe from Brown Eyed Baker's blog. It is fantastic.  I followed the recipe just as written on her blog and came out with a moist cupcake, slightly bitter filling, and a sweet buttercream that happily balanced out the ganache center.  I also went one step farther and mixed up a Bailey's Salted Caramel drizzle for the top and that took them over the top.  (For the drizzle, I used 1/2 cup caramel ice cream topping, a Tbsp of Bailey's, and salted it to taste. )  I'd definitely recommend making these!	i made this recipe from brown eyed baker 's blog . it is fantastic . i followed the recipe just as written on her blog and came out with a moist cupcake , slightly bitter filling , and a sweet buttercream that happily balanced out the ganache center . i also went one step farther and mixed up a bailey 's salted caramel drizzle for the top and that took them over the top . -lrb- for the drizzle , i used 1/2 c up caramel ice cream topping , a tbsp of bailey 's , and salted it to taste . -rrb- i 'd definitely recommend making these !	1
These cupcakes were great!!!! I was skeptical about the syrup part but it worked out great! It didn't harden crunchy it was smooth. These are definately sweet and I upped the anti with the booze. I found that one recipe of the icing was skimpy but two was too much. I like decorating though and used a 2D tip to ice it. They were fantastic and I got rave reviews on them.....and I am not a very proficient baker so that speaks to how easy this recipe comes together. I woke up the next day craving more!	these cupcakes were great !!!! i was skeptical about the syrup part but it worked out great ! it did n't harden crunchy it was smooth . these are definately sweet and i upped the anti with the booze . i fo und that one recipe of the icing was skimpy but two was too much . i like decorating though and used a 2 d tip to ice it . they were fantastic and i got rave reviews on them ... and i am not a very profi cient baker so that speaks to how easy this recipe comes together . i woke up the next day craving more !	1
So far folks love these...a perfect Patty's Day treat. A few notes on prep: FILLING: Melting chocolate is tricky business. Heat the cream slowly on low heat but make sure it is really simmering before adding the chocolate. If you end up with a chunky greasy mixture it means the chocolate didn't temper and you'll need to start over. FROSTING: I agree that the frosting as written isn't quite right and adding more Bailey's is not the best solution for making it fluffier. While it may seem like adding more confectioners sugar would stiffen it (like adding flour) it actually makes the frosting runnier. I increased the butter to 3/4 cup and it was perfect: both in quantity and in consistency.	so far folks love these ... a perfect patty 's day treat . a few notes on prep : filling : melting chocolate is tricky business . heat the cream slowly on low heat but make sure it is really simmering before adding the chocolate . if you end up with a chunky greasy mixture it means the chocolate did n't temper and you 'll need to start over . frosting : i agree that the frosting as written is n't quite right a nd adding more bailey 's is not the best solution for making it fluffier . while it may seem like adding more confectioners sugar would stiffen it -lrb- like adding flour -rrb- it actually makes the frosting runn ier . i increased the butter to 3/4 cup and it was perfect : both in quantity and in consistency .	1
AMAAAAAAAAZING cupcakes!!!! I skipped the filling as I had a lot of baking (and a lot of parties) to do. The cupcakes themselves were DIVINE and rich-tasting.

I've made this cake several times for baby showers and it has been a MAJOR hit every time. It is super easy and has a nice heavy texture. I've only made the cake with 9 inch pans and there was barely enough batter for 2 layers so when I needed a larger cake I just doubled the recipe. I also make sure I make the frosting at least 1 night before I serve the cake because it takes some time for the sugar to fully dissolve but it is perfect the next day. I've also used white chocolate shavings to decorate the top of the cake and it makes it really classy professional looking. No one has to know that it started as a mix!	i 've made this cake several times for baby showers and it has been a major hit every time . it is super easy and has a nice heavy texture . i 've only made the cake with 9 inch pans and there was barely enough batter for 2 layers so when i needed a larger cake i just doubled the recipe . i also make sure i make the frosting at least 1 night before i serve the cake because it takes some time for the su gar to fully dissolve but it is perfect the next day . i 've also used white chocolate shavings to decorate the top of the cake and it makes it really classy professional looking . no one has to know tha t it started as a mix !	1
Delicious cake and the frosting is amazing! I made this recipe for a friends birthday and it received rave reviews. I changed the recipe a bit because my friend requested chocolate cake with chocolate frosting. So I cut each of the three layers in half and frosted every other layer with the candy bar frosting and chocolate on the others. Then I frosted the outside of the cake with chocolate. To decorate I used hershey's hugs because of the brown and white stripes. It matched the inside and was a neat effect.	delicious cake and the frosting is amazing ! i made this recipe for a friends birthday and it received rave reviews . i changed the recipe a bit because my friend requested chocolate cake with chocolate frosting . so i cut each of the three layers in half and frosted every other layer with the candy bar frosting and chocolate on the others . then i frosted the outside of the cake with chocolate . to de corate i used hershey 's hugs because of the brown and white stripes . it matched the inside and was a neat effect .	1

"This is the second time I've attempted adding pudding to a cake mix...I simply don't like it. Instead of tasting light and fluffy it tastes dense and heavy. I did enjoy the concept of the candy bar cake and I liked the frosting so I'm giving it 3 stars. I made it in 3 9"" pans and then layered the frosting in between without frosting the side - so pretty when cut. Will make again but with heavy alterations."	this is the second time i 've attempted adding pudding to a cake mix ... i simply do n't like it . instead of tasting light and fluffy it tastes dense and heavy . i did enjoy the concept of the candy bar ca ke and i liked the frosting so i 'm giving it 3 stars . i made it in 3 9 '' pans and then layered the frosting in between without frosting the side - so pretty when cut . will make again but with heavy alt erations .	1
I have been wanting to try out this recipe ever since Chef John uploaded it to YouTube. I finally got around to making it a few evenings ago. This is my first time making bread and may I just say how simple it is to make! I got so excited seeing it rise in the oven... And boy, when it came out of the oven and I tried a slice (after letting it cool, of course), the flavor is unparalleled. My family and friends loved it...and with a bit of butter and jam...too delicious!! All I can say is that I won't be buying Irish soda bread from Whole Foods anymore...I'll be making my own!!! Please hurry and make this bread now! Your family and friends (as well as your own taste buds) will thank you later!	i have been wanting to try out this recipe ever since chef john uploaded it to youtube . i finally got around to making it a few evenings ago . this is my first time making bread and may i just say how simple it is to make ! i got so excited seeing it rise in the oven ... and boy , when it came out of the oven and i tried a slice -lrb- after letting it cool , of course -rrb- , the flavor is unparalleled . my family and friends loved it ... and with a bit of butter and jam ... too delicious !! all i can say is that i wo n't be buying irish soda bread from whole foods anymore ... i 'll be making my own !!! please hurry and make this bread now ! your family and friends -lrb- as well as your own taste buds -rrb- will thank you later !	1
Followed the directions exactly, and it had a great crunchy crust while remaining moist on the inside. Flavour-wise, it was the perfect balance of subtle sweetness with refreshing orange tanginess.

For the all star Canada Cooks event I made Chef John's Irish Soda Bread using yogurt instead of buttermilk which made it very moist and delicious. I think this is a good bread to have at a luncheon or with tea.  If you are looking for bread sweetened without sugar this is the one to try with honey and raisins for extra sweetness.	for the all star canada cooks event i made chef john 's irish soda bread using yogurt instead of buttermilk which made it very moist and delicious . i think this is a good bread to have at a luncheon or with tea . if you are looking for bread sweetened without sugar this is the one to try with honey and raisins for extra sweetness .	1

I've been obsessed with Irish soda bread since getting some from a local bakery around St. Patty's. This recipe was outstanding even with a few modifications. I love oats so added an extra 1/4 cup. I subtracted a 1/4 cup flour to keep the dry measures the same. I only used whole wheat flour not all-purpose for part. This created a lovely brown bread. I used fennel seeds in place of the orange zest and I highly recommend this. Finally I realized at the last moment that I didn't have parchment paper so I greased my cast iron skillet and made one large loaf. My husband and I already ate half with dinner!	i 've been obsessed with irish soda bread since getting some from a local bakery around st. patty 's . this recipe was outstanding even with a few modifications . i love oats so added an extra 1/4 cup . i subtracted a 1/4 cup flour to keep the dry measures the same . i only used whole wheat flour not all-purpose for part . this created a lovely brown bread . i used fennel seeds in place of the orange zest and i highly recommend this . finally i realized at the last moment that i did n't have parchment paper so i greased my cast iron skillet and made one large loaf . my husband and i already ate half with dinner !	1
I don't bake much, just started making a few loaves of bread this year. And I don't recall eating Irish soda bread anywhere recently so I can't compare my creation to anybody else's. That said, this recipe came out marvelously! Took a lot of work because the dough is so wet and sticky, getting it to set a little so I could handle it was a test of my patience. I didn't have buttermilk so I made my own as per Chef John's blog. But the work paid off because this is a great breakfast bread or perfect with afternoon tea/coffee. Warning; if you're late out of bed you'll likely find it already gone!	i do n't bake much , just started making a few loaves of bread this year . and i do n't recall eating irish soda bread anywhere recently so i ca n't compare my creation to anybody else 's . that said , this r ecipe came out marvelously ! took a lot of work because the dough is so wet and sticky , getting it to set a little so i could handle it was a test of my patience . i did n't have buttermilk so i made my own as per chef john 's blog . but the work paid off because this is a great breakfast bread or perfect with afternoon tea/coffee . warning ; if you 're late out of bed you 'll likely find it already gone !	1

I made the recipe pretty much as written. I increased whole wheat flour to 1 cup and decreased all purpose to 2 3/4 cups. The dough was so wet and unmanageable. I had to dust frequently with flour just to get it off the kneading surface and my hands. So I probably added an extra 1/4 cup of flour. That is why it has a 3 star rating. On the upside I loved the flavor and especially the orange zest that sets it apart from other soda breads. The texture was a bit crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I might make this again...and maybe decreased the buttermilk.	i made the recipe pretty much as written . i increased whole wheat flour to 1 cup and decreased all purpose to 2 3/4 cups . the dough was so wet and unmanageable . i had to dust frequently with flour jus t to get it off the kneading surface and my hands . so i probably added an extra 1/4 cup of flour . that is why it has a 3 star rating . on the upside i loved the flavor and especially the orange zest th at sets it apart from other soda breads . the texture was a bit crispy on the outside and tender on the inside . i might make this again ... and maybe decreased the buttermilk .	1

I will definitely make this crust again. I made it as directed only substituting 3T of vodka for 3 of the T of water. Just as described the crust had an amazing buttery taste and was simple to make. I was able to roll the dough out without any additional flour on my board or rolling pin. I left out one star because even though I rolled the dough a bit thinner than 1/4 inch I still did not have enough dough to make a pretty thickly crimped edge on either of the two pies I made. Next time I will make a recipe and a half to make crusts for two pies. When the recipe says it make two pie crusts I wish it would specify the size of the pie plate. I didn't think mine were that big but I guess that must be the problem.	i will definitely make this crust again . i made it as directed only substituting 3 t of vodka for 3 of the t of water . just as described the crust had an amazing buttery taste and was simple to make . i was able to roll the dough out without any additional flour on my board or rolling pin . i left out one star because even though i rolled the dough a bit thinner than 1/4 inch i still did not have eno ugh dough to make a pretty thickly crimped edge on either of the two pies i made . next time i will make a recipe and a half to make crusts for two pies . when the recipe says it make two pie crusts i w ish it would specify the size of the pie plate . i did n't think mine were that big but i guess that must be the problem .	1

Delicious!! I made my own Cuban bread from your recipe: outstanding bread taste!  I am going to do 3 things differently the next time I make this. First: Pat dry the pickle slices. Second: coat both sides of the sandwich with the mayo/mustard sauce completely, but keep it a thin layer. Third: Rinse the barbecue sauce  off the precooked pulled pork I used and pat it dry.  I had a problem with the sandwich toppings oozing out of the sides when I compressed it.  I'm thinking the drier it is on the inside going into the pan, the less will ooze out during cooking.  (It was still yummy!)

These buns bake up to a beautiful color inside and out are soft and fluffy exquisite taste and were the perfect choice for some Asian Turkey Burgers. I did flatten each bun as I placed it on the baking sheet but next time I will flatten a bit more as they had more of a dome than I would have liked. Beautiful dough easy to work with and definitely worth the effort to make.	these buns bake up to a beautiful color inside and out are soft and fluffy exquisite taste and were the perfect choice for some asian turkey burgers . i did flatten each bun as i placed it on the bakin g sheet but next time i will flatten a bit more as they had more of a dome than i would have liked . beautiful dough easy to work with and definitely worth the effort to make .	1

"Excellent  for use on 2 generous servings of Benedicts. I always add a few drops of hot sauce and Worcestershire to my sauce. Use lowest flame possible and continually move and adjust the height of the pan over the flame, wisking constantly.  DO NOT place pan directly down on the stove. Watch very carefully because it thickens quickly once up to temp. See Chef John's video on this open flame method on this site.  I personally like to use just one teaspoon of lemon juice.
    For a quick béarnaise sauce try adding a few drops of balsamic or red wine vinegar along with some tarragon, parsley, onion powder and fresh ground pepper."	excellent for use on 2 generous servings of benedicts . i always add a few drops of hot sauce and worcestershire to my sauce . use lowest flame possible and continually move and adjust the height of th e pan over the flame , wisking constantly . do not place pan directly down on the stove . watch very carefully because it thickens quickly once up to temp . see chef john 's video on this open flame metho d on this site . i personally like to use just one teaspoon of lemon juice . for a quick béarnaise sauce try adding a few drops of balsamic or red wine vinegar along with some tarragon , parsley , on ion powder and fresh ground pepper .	1

I was skeptical at first but decided to try this. I used ground white pepper instead of the others to keep the color and I doubled the batch. Turned out amazing! No more worrying about it breaking though that wasn't a problem for me anymore anyway.

This was great! My parents loved it. I messed up at first and put the mixture in a little hot, warning let it completely cool down! The dough will rip and the liquid will seep out. I also didn't pinch the edges good enough. Then I made more and they came out great. I also added blueberries into the second batch with the apples which was really nice too.	this was great ! my parents loved it . i messed up at first and put the mixture in a little hot , warning let it completely cool down ! the dough will rip and the liquid will seep out . i also did n't pinch the edges good enough . then i made more and they came out great . i also added blueberries into the second batch with the apples which was really nice too .	1

Very easy and delicious. I made my apple filling the night before and left it in the fridge so the flavor could really seep into the apples.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I had some store-bought pie dough that I had to use up as we had no electricity for a day due to an earthquake. The only fruit I had in the house was one nectarine but I remembered that green tomatoes could be used when you don't have enough apples so I used one large nectarine and two small green tomatoes for the filling. The only other thing I changed was to substitute vanilla for some of the cinnamon. My gas oven runs a little hot so they turned out a little brown but so delicious! I will definitely be making this again!	thank you so much for this recipe ! i had some store-bought pie dough that i had to use up as we had no electricity for a day due to an earthquake . the only fruit i had in the house was one nectarine b ut i remembered that green tomatoes could be used when you do n't have enough apples so i used one large nectarine and two small green tomatoes for the filling . the only other thing i changed was to su bstitute vanilla for some of the cinnamon . my gas oven runs a little hot so they turned out a little brown but so delicious ! i will definitely be making this again !	1

I know people will hate me for this so my apologies in advance but I wanted to make cherry turnovers (without frying) and had no idea how to do it. I used a prepackaged crust I had to get rid of and canned cherries (blech I know) but for the record baking method was spot on. Cut dough into quarters rolled out and finished as directed for above pies. Husband loved. Can't wait to try it with fresh apples.	i know people will hate me for this so my apologies in advance but i wanted to make cherry turnovers -lrb- without frying -rrb- and had no idea how to do it . i used a prepackaged crust i had to get rid of and c anned cherries -lrb- blech i know -rrb- but for the record baking method was spot on . cut dough into quarters rolled out and finished as directed for above pies . husband loved . ca n't wait to try it with fresh a pples .	1
Whoa! So much cinnamon! So much sugar! It was way too sweet and I couldn't even taste the apples so I tossed it and started again so as not to waste the pie crust. I'm going to go with half the white sugar and a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon which is 1/6 what the recipe calls for.	whoa ! so much cinnamon ! so much sugar ! it was way too sweet and i could n't even taste the apples so i tossed it and started again so as not to waste the pie crust . i 'm going to go with half the white sugar and a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon which is 1/6 what the recipe calls for .	1
This ranks up there with my all time favorite soups. First of all, double the recipe, it's too much trouble and too good to only get 4 servings out of this soup. To help you decide how much pepper to use, use the full amount of ancho chili pepper.  Ancho chili pepper only adds depth of flavor not heat.  I did cut in half the chipotle chili pepper (that is where the heat is.  I used the full amount of cayenne.  I added a diced red pepper as I sautéed the onion. When you add the beans also add 2 cups of white frozen corn. For the garnish also use broken lime tortilla chips.  I promise, doing it this way will not be too spicy hot but just wonderful.	this ranks up there with my all time favorite soups . first of all , double the recipe , it 's too much trouble and too good to only get 4 servings out of this soup . to help you decide how much pepper to use , use the full amount of ancho chili pepper . ancho chili pepper only adds depth of flavor not heat . i did cut in half the chipotle chili pepper -lrb- that is where the heat is . i used the full amount of cayenne . i added a diced red pepper as i sautéed the onion . when you add the beans also add 2 cups of white frozen corn . for the garnish also use broken lime tortilla chips . i promise , doing it this way will not be too spicy hot but just wonderful .	2

Extremely Spicy- too overwhelming with the different chili powders. I only used one TEASPOON of the ancho chile powder not one tablespoon as the recipe calls for. I am glad I listened to my common sense. I usually like spicy food but wish I had reduced the peppers even more. If you want to try this recipe start with 1/4 the amount of ground peppers it calls for and then add more if you like. I wonder if all the rave reviews came from people who do not have these particular spices in their cabinet so they substituted a milder chili powder.	extremely spicy - too overwhelming with the different chili powders . i only used one teaspoon of the ancho chile powder not one tablespoon as the recipe calls for . i am glad i listened to my common sen se . i usually like spicy food but wish i had reduced the peppers even more . if you want to try this recipe start with 1/4 the amount of ground peppers it calls for and then add more if you like . i won der if all the rave reviews came from people who do not have these particular spices in their cabinet so they substituted a milder chili powder .	1
I made this tonight when the boyfriend came home sick. Spicy food always makes him feel better and man was this spicy. I made a few changes--I didn't have chipotle or ancho chile powder on hand so I used a generic chili powder blend and threw a couple adobo chipotle peppers in with the spices deseeded and chopped. I added a little cinnamon and just a dash of cloves because I think they play with the other flavors well and add a hint of complexity. This is a keeper. It's quick it's cheap it's delicious and if you have a 3 quart skillet it only uses one pan. A perfect dinner to spice up the middle of the week. No pun intended honestly.	i made this tonight when the boyfriend came home sick . spicy food always makes him feel better and man was this spicy . i made a few changes -- i did n't have chipotle or ancho chile powder on hand so i u sed a generic chili powder blend and threw a couple adobo chipotle peppers in with the spices deseeded and chopped . i added a little cinnamon and just a dash of cloves because i think they play with t he other flavors well and add a hint of complexity . this is a keeper . it 's quick it 's cheap it 's delicious and if you have a 3 quart skillet it only uses one pan . a perfect dinner to spice up the midd le of the week . no pun intended honestly .	1
I used this recipe as a basis for a white bean chicken chili cook off. I won! Of course I changed a few basic steps to suit my personal taste & spice it up a bit. I used a Costco rotisserie chicken as it has SO much flavor. Then used several packets of the new Campbell's Chicken & quinoa soup as well as chicken broth. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. Oops A little more cayenne pepper! Lots of cilantro for garnish. It was fabulous! Everyone loved it. It took a long time to make but was worth it. Try it! You'll be glad you did! I won 1st place out of 12 entries.

I ll admit that I m a baby when it comes to spicy food but my husband enjoys a good fiery dish from time to time. When I cook I try to reach a happy medium that will satisfy both of us. I was nervous about the amount of chili powder in this recipe so I started with just half the amount. Turns out even that was way too much and hubby agreed. I trust his judgement when he says it s overkill. The saving grace for this recipe is the toppings. The sour cream cools it down and the fresh cilantro and green onions gives it much needed flavor. Suffice to say we did not skimp with the toppings!	i ll admit that i m a baby when it comes to spicy food but my husband enjoys a good fiery dish from time to time . when i cook i try to reach a happy medium that will satisfy both of us . i was nervous about the amount of chili powder in this recipe so i started with just half the amount . turns out even that was way too much and hubby agreed . i trust his judgement when he says it s overkill . the sav ing grace for this recipe is the toppings . the sour cream cools it down and the fresh cilantro and green onions gives it much needed flavor . suffice to say we did not skimp with the toppings !	1

I added the ingredients Chef John puts in his Tomato Sauce recipe also on this site i.e. 1 rib celery 2 tea sugar 1 tea anchovy paste 1 tea white wine vinegar and 1/2 tea dried Italian herbs. It is so heavenly and old fashion tasting it almost brings tears to my eyes.	i have it simmering on my stove now and it is the best sauce i 've ever made and i 'm an old italian fuss . i added the ingredients chef john puts in his tomato sauce recipe also on this site i.e. 1 rib celery 2 tea sugar 1 tea anchovy paste 1 tea white wine vinegar and 1/2 tea dried italian herbs . it is so heavenly and old fashion tasting it almost brings tears to my eyes .	1
So this is how my mother in law taught me to make sauce. We brown the meat bones in the pot we cook the sauce in rather than in the oven. The brown bits are already there. The meatballs we do cook on a cookie sheet in the oven We also add a little vino. Red or white works. We eat it that day and freeze the leftovers in single meal containers or freezer bags.	so this is how my mother in law taught me to make sauce . we brown the meat bones in the pot we cook the sauce in rather than in the oven . the brown bits are already there . the meatballs we do cook on a cookie sheet in the oven we also add a little vino . red or white works . we eat it that day and freeze the leftovers in single meal containers or freezer bags .	1

This looks just like the sauce my grandmother and aunts used to make. I've gotten away from putting meat in my sauce and really hate ground meat in sauce. Think I'll go back to this method. From my memories this is awesome. When Grandma made polenta the sauce she used was like this only she used Italian sausage simmered in the sauce - it was outstanding.

There are many variations of this. We went to my grandmother's every Sunday for her version. Chef John's looks excellent as usual. My grandmother canned her own tomatoes from Italy once or twice a year in her basement kitchen. The whole family got together to help. Memories.

For the most part I followed the recipe, the only thing I did different was I cooked the corned beef brisket in the slow cooker for a day and a half, but that was more for my benefit. I love the smell in my house and also it made chopping it easier, it just falls apart. I have never cooked corned beef so I never dreamed I could make corned beef hash. The recipe is simple and tasty! Huge success. And it freezes well, this makes a lot for two people to eat so we froze most of it. We just take it out and put it in the fridge the night before then pop it in the microwave. Yumm!

The flavor is out of this world good and I used baby red potatoes because I like to leave them unpeeled. The fire roasted salsa adds a delicious but subtle Southwestern flavor and instead of poached egg I topped the hash with more salsa and some sour cream. I had trouble flipping the hash in pieces so I did the best I could and just cooked it until it was crisp in pieces.

Very Good! I had some left over roast beef that I needed to use up and went looking for a hash recipe.  My mom made it for us many years ago to use up roast beef (and probably lamb or other roasts) and I recall her grinding the cooked meat but I just chopped it up.  I used olive oil and regular onion as that was what I had.  I didn't have the proper salsa but served it with ketchup like my mom did.  Delish!!  It brought back good memories, too. Thank you for the recipe.  Next time I'll try it with the salsa.	very good ! i had some left over roast beef that i needed to use up and went looking for a hash recipe . my mom made it for us many years ago to use up roast beef -lrb- and probably lamb or other roasts -rrb- an d i recall her grinding the cooked meat but i just chopped it up . i used olive oil and regular onion as that was what i had . i did n't have the proper salsa but served it with ketchup like my mom did . delish !! it brought back good memories , too . thank you for the recipe . next time i 'll try it with the salsa .	1

Wonderful scone recipe - I froze the butter and then grated it into the dry ingredients. I added a little more sugar, as I love a sweet scone. I used half and half instead of milk and after the egg wash topped them off with turbinado sugar for that extra added crunch. This is a great base for add-ins like dried cranberries and white or dark chocolate chips. These come out of the oven beautiful... almost look too good to eat!	wonderful scone recipe - i froze the butter and then grated it into the dry ingredients . i added a little more sugar , as i love a sweet scone . i used half and half instead of milk and after the egg wa sh topped them off with turbinado sugar for that extra added crunch . this is a great base for add-ins like dried cranberries and white or dark chocolate chips . these come out of the oven beautiful ... almost look too good to eat !	2

This would be a 5-star recipe if the measurements were accurate. I was hoping for some reader comments but had to figure it out myself. I ended up increasing the amount of flour to about 2 cups and I would have added just a little bit more sugar (not too much since scones shouldn't be overly sweet and it would overpower the natural sweetness of the orange/cranberries I used). With those adjustments though it's a great recipe! Very authentic and delicious! The center is moist but it's got a nice crusty outside. Like other reviewers said it's so versatile! I might try lemon or candied ginger next time.	this would be a 5 star recipe if the measurements were accurate . i was hoping for some reader comments but had to figure it out myself . i ended up increasing the amount of flour to about 2 cups and i would have added just a little bit more sugar -lrb- not too much since scones should n't be overly sweet and it would overpower the natural sweetness of the orange/cranberries i used -rrb- . with those adjustment s though it 's a great recipe ! very authentic and delicious ! the center is moist but it 's got a nice crusty outside . like other reviewers said it 's so versatile ! i might try lemon or candied ginger nex t time .	1

I always save my rotisserie ckn carcasses after I trim off the leftover meat @ freeze that in a separate pkg with the carcass. Broth is so much better when made with rotesserie ckn. Pretty much followed the recipe & added trimmings at the end.  Great way to use up rotisserie ckn & get a bigger bang for your buck. Your only expense is the price of the veggies & if you're like me you have them in the fridge anyways. A pot of soup for no extra cost!  If I'm not going to serve right away I cook the noodles separate.  If they're left in overnite they tend to swell & absorb the broth.  So I just toss them in when I'm reheating the soup.	i always save my rotisserie ckn carcasses after i trim off the leftover meat @ freeze that in a separate pkg with the carcass . broth is so much better when made with rotesserie ckn . pretty much follow ed the recipe & added trimmings at the end . great way to use up rotisserie ckn & get a bigger bang for your buck . your only expense is the price of the veggies & if you 're like me you have them in th e fridge anyways . a pot of soup for no extra cost ! if i 'm not going to serve right away i cook the noodles separate . if they 're left in overnite they tend to swell & absorb the broth . so i just tos s them in when i 'm reheating the soup .	1

Changed a couple of things.  Poached the chicken breasts with a little olive oil, celery and onion with chicken granules and four cups of water.

My first time ever making wings... I'm not a big fan of BBQ. I loved these! couldn't stop eating them. They are nice and spicy but not so much as to hide the excellent flavor. I would never guessed they were baked if I hadn't done it myself. I shook them in a gallon sealed bag to coat them I thought it was easier.	my first time ever making wings ... i 'm not a big fan of bbq . i loved these ! could n't stop eating them . they are nice and spicy but not so much as to hide the excellent flavor . i would never guessed th ey were baked if i had n't done it myself . i shook them in a gallon sealed bag to coat them i thought it was easier .	1
My fiancé is obsessed with wings. He wants to go out for them about once a week. After eating these he said he would never have to go out for wings again. They are absolutely incredible and was easier than I expected them to be.

These were excellent!!! I par broiled and let cool the night before then stuck them in fridge overnight still in par broil recipe. I took them out of that then let them dry the next morning prepared as recipe states then put them in a crockpot on warm to serve at a Sunday football party. Everyone raved about them and wanted the recipe.	these were excellent !!! i par broiled and let cool the night before then stuck them in fridge overnight still in par broil recipe . i took them out of that then let them dry the next morning prepared a s recipe states then put them in a crockpot on warm to serve at a sunday football party . everyone raved about them and wanted the recipe .	1

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very tasty. Not as spicy as I expected with the cayenne pepper. Next time I will add more since we like spicy food. The green olives and capers give it an interesting slightly salty flavor so you might want to cut back on the added salt. Cumin was the predominant flavor. If you don't like cumin cut back on it but I wouldn't eliminate it altogether. The chicken was done through but not overcooked. If you watch Chef John's video you will notice that he uses less than a whole onion. Some of his other ingredients were less than what the recipe calls for. And he does not include the back pieces of the chicken. I did because I like those bony parts. All-in-all a good recipe and worth repeating. We are looking forward to leftovers since there only two of us and it makes a lot.	i followed the recipe exactly and it was very tasty . not as spicy as i expected with the cayenne pepper . next time i will add more since we like spicy food . the green olives and capers give it an inte resting slightly salty flavor so you might want to cut back on the added salt . cumin was the predominant flavor . if you do n't like cumin cut back on it but i would n't eliminate it altogether . the chic ken was done through but not overcooked . if you watch chef john 's video you will notice that he uses less than a whole onion . some of his other ingredients were less than what the recipe calls for . an d he does not include the back pieces of the chicken . i did because i like those bony parts . all-in-all a good recipe and worth repeating . we are looking forward to leftovers since there only two of u s and it makes a lot .	1

I was looking for something different to do with my chicken breasts and this recipe was on the front page including a video on how to prepare. So easy and tasty and a big hit with the family! Didn't have to run to the grocery store because I had everything on hand. I lied - except for the chipotle seasoning! I did a web search and found I could use a paprika red pepper with a dash of chili powder as a substitute. About 1/2 tsp. paprika 1/8 red pepper and a dash of chili powder. Will look for chipotle seasoning for the next time I make this!	i was looking for something different to do with my chicken breasts and this recipe was on the front page including a video on how to prepare . so easy and tasty and a big hit with the family ! did n't h ave to run to the grocery store because i had everything on hand . i lied - except for the chipotle seasoning ! i did a web search and found i could use a paprika red pepper with a dash of chili powder as a substitute . about 1/2 tsp . paprika 1/8 red pepper and a dash of chili powder . will look for chipotle seasoning for the next time i make this !	1

This is my first Chef John recipe that I was able to follow as it was really simple. I made it with a slight variation - did not have cayenne pepper and used paprika and did not have parsley so left it out but it was all good at the end and very surprised with the taste it gave. Only warning is that the mushroom while sautéing may release heaps and heaps of water and would affect cooking the fish - may need to consider sautéing the mushrooms until all the liquids have evaporated.	this is my first chef john recipe that i was able to follow as it was really simple . i made it with a slight variation - did not have cayenne pepper and used paprika and did not have parsley so left i t out but it was all good at the end and very surprised with the taste it gave . only warning is that the mushroom while sautéing may release heaps and heaps of water and would affect cooking the fish - may need to consider sautéing the mushrooms until all the liquids have evaporated .	1
This was fantastic.  I did not use the cayenne (family members are not fans of hot/spicy) and I used white wine instead of the suggested water to deglaze the pan for the sauce.

Made this last night for my family. Ingredients pretty easy to find although clamshell mushrooms very expensive i used chanterelles and oyster varieties for 1/3 the price. recipe very easy to follow. everybody loved it! the sauce was excellent and very light. added this to my recipe box for sure. served with some simple sauteed snap peas and some fresh boule bread. this was an easy winner. would be a great idea for a special family dinner when prep time is an issue. thanks for the very nice recipe chef John	made this last night for my family . ingredients pretty easy to find although clamshell mushrooms very expensive i used chanterelles and oyster varieties for 1/3 the price . recipe very easy to follow . everybody loved it ! the sauce was excellent and very light . added this to my recipe box for sure . served with some simple sauteed snap peas and some fresh boule bread . this was an easy winner . would b e a great idea for a special family dinner when prep time is an issue . thanks for the very nice recipe chef john	1

This was not a difficult recipe. I did use boneless chicken and followed everything else. I worked fine. This is not the BEST fried chicken I have had, but it was tasty and nice and crispy. I did not need 2 cups of buttermilk, so just pour in as much as you need to cover the chicken good. The rest of the ingredients I used the same. I used about 2 inches of oil to fry in and let it get good and brown.	this was not a difficult recipe . i did use boneless chicken and followed everything else . i worked fine . this is not the best fried chicken i have had , but it was tasty and nice and crispy . i did not need 2 cups of buttermilk , so just pour in as much as you need to cover the chicken good . the rest of the ingredients i used the same . i used about 2 inches of oil to fry in and let it get good and br own .	1

Did this recipe twice. First time to me was 4-star. To make it 5-star for my family and I I ditched the cornmeal subbed buttermilk for the regular milk and doubled it and used a LOT more cayenne (bringing it closer to the recipe I've always used). Follow the actual process of preparing the tomatoes and cooking them. These steps are very important and Chef John has laid them out very well. When finished I used my own remoulade recipe (relish mayo lemon juice hot sauce cayenne paprika s&p blended smooth) and stacked my tomatoes with crab cakes with the remoulade (mixed with tiny salad shrimp) over all.

I thought this was really good. Easy to make and I'd recommend using the thighs versus breasts b/c the meat was moist and tender and I think a breast would be dry.

I loved this recipe. Have made coconut curries many times before but this was particularly good. I used skinless thighs to reduce the fat. I also used coconut oil to fry them in beforehand. I chose green beans for the veg and they were great. I also used a popular curry paste. Making it again tonight. I will be using a green curry paste this time. And cod and shrimp instead of chicken. I will also include Sweet potato with the green beans. Because we like it hot and the kiddo does not I make the curry sauce saving about a cup. I blend this with the jalapeños and heat in a small pan separately. When serving we just add a big spoonful of this superheated sauce for heat and flavor.	i loved this recipe . have made coconut curries many times before but this was particularly good . i used skinless thighs to reduce the fat . i also used coconut oil to fry them in beforehand . i chose gr een beans for the veg and they were great . i also used a popular curry paste . making it again tonight . i will be using a green curry paste this time . and cod and shrimp instead of chicken . i will also include sweet potato with the green beans . because we like it hot and the kiddo does not i make the curry sauce saving about a cup . i blend this with the jalapeños and heat in a small pan separately . when serving we just add a big spoonful of this superheated sauce for heat and flavor .	1
This was the best recipes I've made from this site. Amazing!!! We love the green curry beef from the local Thai place and we've been craving it. Well no need to crave again. I followed the recipe pretty much all the way except: I used 4 legs and 4 thighs (still had plenty of sauce) my store didn't have Thai basil so I had to use regular. What I'd change: we like it spicy so I'm going to leave the seeds in 1 or 2 of the jalapeños more ginger (I wish the amount noted in the recipe was more specific) I'd change nothing else. The sweet potato and eggplant were delightful. I'm going to try this with beef next time. Definitely a keeper	this was the best recipes i 've made from this site . amazing !!! we love the green curry beef from the local thai place and we 've been craving it . well no need to crave again . i followed the recipe pret ty much all the way except : i used 4 legs and 4 thighs -lrb- still had plenty of sauce -rrb- my store did n't have thai basil so i had to use regular . what i 'd change : we like it spicy so i 'm going to leave the seeds in 1 or 2 of the jalapeños more ginger -lrb- i wish the amount noted in the recipe was more specific -rrb- i 'd change nothing else . the sweet potato and eggplant were delightful . i 'm going to try this wit h beef next time . definitely a keeper	1
I love this recipe but I make some modifications. I use chicken breasts instead of legs. Cut up and sear the chicken pieces. I also change out the veggies - I don't love eggplant. Use veggies that won't get soggy like a mixture of carrots potatoes green beans broccoli variety of peppers asparagus etc. You can substitute ginger powder for the fresh ginger if needed but I prefer the fresh. Once this is done cooking and ready to serve I add either sour cream OR greek yogurt (add either to taste) to the sauce and heat just enough to serving temperature - - - it helps slightly with the flavor and makes it a lot less runny.	i love this recipe but i make some modifications . i use chicken breasts instead of legs . cut up and sear the chicken pieces . i also change out the veggies - i do n't love eggplant . use veggies that won ' t get soggy like a mixture of carrots potatoes green beans broccoli variety of peppers asparagus etc. . you can substitute ginger powder for the fresh ginger if needed but i prefer the fresh . once this is done cooking and ready to serve i add either sour cream or greek yogurt -lrb- add either to taste -rrb- to the sauce and heat just enough to serving temperature - - - it helps slightly with the flavor and m akes it a lot less runny .	1

I think the eggplant and sweet potato kind of stole the show and the red curry made the dish look a lot less green. I may try this again and modify it a bit.

My chickens are giving me 10 eggs a day so I'm always trying to find new recipes to use the eggs up!!!

Very good...I had some kalamata olives which I added albeit sparingly because of the salt. Turned out just as promised. Note that the video and the recipe are different at least with regards to cooking the spinach. I sauteed mine.

I have made this twice now.. It is a nice change from the quiche with cottage cheese that I make. It is firm and delicious, great warm or cold as leftovers from the fridge. The texture is wonderful. The feta cheese adds the perfect amount of saltiness and compliments the eggs and spinach without overpowering the favors.	i have made this twice now . . it is a nice change from the quiche with cottage cheese that i make . it is firm and delicious , great warm or cold as leftovers from the fridge . the texture is wonderful . t he feta cheese adds the perfect amount of saltiness and compliments the eggs and spinach without overpowering the favors .	1

Make sure the mixture is no more than an inch deep...use a large enough dish... or it takes much longer to bake and may not set in the center. I also almost doubled the cheese and it was great.

This was very welcome for dinner here.  It was a tad sweet for me - but I am the odd-ball, everyone else loved it.  I followed the recipe and method with the exception of finely chopping the jalapeno pepper.  I did this is a heavy duty wok - really high heat and didn't have to spoon off any extra liquid from the chicken.  I didn't need half of the marinade either.  I used a large spoon and spooned a couple of spoonfulls of the marinade around the edge of the very hot wok  - so the liquid would immediately come to a boil and thicken quickly.  Thanks for a great recipe.

A lighter healthier version of American Chinese orange chicken. We made this as written except for omitting the cilantro garnish. For us it s hard to beat orange chicken when well prepared by a fine Chinese restaurant as the flavor of the sauce is absorbed and clings to the battered fried chicken. This dish eliminates the batter and oil for cooking the chicken which reduces some fat and calories. We were very pleased with the outcome and thought this dish delivered a savory balance of sweet and spicy flavors. We will make this again.	a lighter healthier version of american chinese orange chicken . we made this as written except for omitting the cilantro garnish . for us it s hard to beat orange chicken when well prepared by a fine c hinese restaurant as the flavor of the sauce is absorbed and clings to the battered fried chicken . this dish eliminates the batter and oil for cooking the chicken which reduces some fat and calories . we were very pleased with the outcome and thought this dish delivered a savory balance of sweet and spicy flavors . we will make this again .	1

Followed all directions and the ingredients except: 1) used 1 habanero pepper instead of jalapeno 2) did not use the green onions 3)used green peas instead of snap peas 4) chicken breast instead of thighs because the above were the ones we had on hand. I will use the habanero again for this recipe I think it is a more flavorful heat than jalapeno. Will get green onions next time for more texture/flavor. It tastes like Chinese take-out orange chicken minus the calorific batter around the chicken and it is truly non-greasy!!! Loved it!!! But I am taking 1 star off because the recommended length of cooking the chicken made it dry and overcooked. But I will make it again when I have a hankering for Chinese food without the extra calories.	followed all directions and the ingredients except : 1 -rrb- used 1 habanero pepper instead of jalapeno 2 -rrb- did not use the green onions 3 -rrb- used green peas instead of snap peas 4 -rrb- chicken breast instead of th ighs because the above were the ones we had on hand . i will use the habanero again for this recipe i think it is a more flavorful heat than jalapeno . will get green onions next time for more texture/f lavor . it tastes like chinese take-out orange chicken minus the calorific batter around the chicken and it is truly non-greasy !!! loved it !!! but i am taking 1 star off because the recommended length of cooking the chicken made it dry and overcooked . but i will make it again when i have a hankering for chinese food without the extra calories .	1

I made the recipe exactly as presented but used boneless chicken breast. I thought the amount of ginger overpowered the orange flavor so I would cut the amount at least in half. I also think I would cut down slightly on the brown sugar. And I thought the sauce was too thin so next time I would thicken it slightly with a little cornstarch dissolved in a little water. I think the recipe has potential to be a four with these changes.	i made the recipe exactly as presented but used boneless chicken breast . i thought the amount of ginger overpowered the orange flavor so i would cut the amount at least in half . i also think i would c ut down slightly on the brown sugar . and i thought the sauce was too thin so next time i would thicken it slightly with a little cornstarch dissolved in a little water . i think the recipe has potentia l to be a four with these changes .	1
My husband and I loved this recipe but next time I'll make a few changes. First I don't know how large a jalapeno Chef John used but this was SPICY!!! I'm a little bit of a wuss but my husband isn't and even he found it hot enough which he usually doesn't. Next time I'll use 1/2 the jalapenos take my portion out of the pan add the other 1/2 and give it to Mr. I can eat anything. The other thing is the cooking times are all a bit long. Use your judgment. Finally sorry Chef John but I don't like to add my snow pea pods that early. I added them with the jalapenos at the end. I like them quite crispy and just heated through. My version came out a bit darker than in the video but it was delicious and a definite keeper.	my husband and i loved this recipe but next time i 'll make a few changes . first i do n't know how large a jalapeno chef john used but this was spicy !!! i 'm a little bit of a wuss but my husband is n't a nd even he found it hot enough which he usually does n't . next time i 'll use 1/2 the jalapenos take my portion out of the pan add the other 1/2 and give it to mr. i can eat anything . the other thing is the cooking times are all a bit long . use your judgment . finally sorry chef john but i do n't like to add my snow pea pods that early . i added them with the jalapenos at the end . i like them quite cri spy and just heated through . my version came out a bit darker than in the video but it was delicious and a definite keeper .	1
I love to make these! My mother was from Poland and she used sweet pickle instead...both have a great flavor. I also like the way you use the whole piece of meat and roll up. I would cut it up into 3 pieces and makes smaller rollups which is so much work. and I use toothpicks..my mother also made a saltine cracker stuffing (crushed crackers chopped onions 1 egg Kellogg's corn flake crumbs and milk) rollup along with the pickle ones.

Really tasty ate along side some caprese salad and some garlic bread and it was delicious. However the gnocchi took FOREVER to cook. Much longer than it said in the video and on the recipe. We think it was because we did not drain the ricotta because we just bought some cheap not fancy-basket ricotta but did not read the note about having to drain it. So if you do not buy basket ricotta make sure you drain it otherwise the gnocchi will take forever!	really tasty ate along side some caprese salad and some garlic bread and it was delicious . however the gnocchi took forever to cook . much longer than it said in the video and on the recipe . we think i t was because we did not drain the ricotta because we just bought some cheap not fancy-basket ricotta but did not read the note about having to drain it . so if you do not buy basket ricotta make sure you drain it otherwise the gnocchi will take forever !	1

Who knew gnocchi was this simple to make... The basil was so aromatic but like someone else said it turned brown in the blender even after blanching in warm water. No way did it look as green as chef John's. Made the ricotta from the epicurious recipe. I rolled the dough into rolls and cut it to save time rather than scooping one by one into the pan. These were super easy quick (if you make the ricotta ahead of time or buy it) and tasty. Will be making this again and again - thank you for a fool-proof recipe!	who knew gnocchi was this simple to make ... the basil was so aromatic but like someone else said it turned brown in the blender even after blanching in warm water . no way did it look as green as chef john 's . made the ricotta from the epicurious recipe . i rolled the dough into rolls and cut it to save time rather than scooping one by one into the pan . these were super easy quick -lrb- if you make the ri cotta ahead of time or buy it -rrb- and tasty . will be making this again and again - thank you for a fool-proof recipe !	1

This was the wettest recipe for gnocchi that I thought it was labeled in error and was supposed to be a spaetzle. I dusted the dough generously with flour in order to cut and shape them and then it was still a challenge.

Wow. I followed this recipe instructions exactly except for the fact that I had no idea where to find cloves and I don't personally like mushrooms. Yes it takes a while but you can reasonably break down tasks simultaneously. So that not much prep time is needed and much of your dishes and waste are already dealt with before the meal is prepared. This meal was incredible. It's better than most restaurants. I used a stock pot for the first step and a dutch oven for steps three through six. In hindsight I wish I had used chicken broth instead of water in step one. Even without I am telling you this stew is incredible. The combination of herbs is good. One set of herbs (tarragon rosemary herbes de Provence) reminds me a little of absinthe for some reason while the others added plenty of spiciness. I highly recommend this meal. It deserves WAY more reviews. It is spicy hot as some noted but not overly so. If one doesn't want it they could probably leave out the cayenne pepper. I think the cayenne pepper makes it perfect however.	wow . i followed this recipe instructions exactly except for the fact that i had no idea where to find cloves and i do n't personally like mushrooms . yes it takes a while but you can reasonably break do wn tasks simultaneously . so that not much prep time is needed and much of your dishes and waste are already dealt with before the meal is prepared . this meal was incredible . it 's better than most rest aurants . i used a stock pot for the first step and a dutch oven for steps three through six . in hindsight i wish i had used chicken broth instead of water in step one . even without i am telling you th is stew is incredible . the combination of herbs is good . one set of herbs -lrb- tarragon rosemary herbes de provence -rrb- reminds me a little of absinthe for some reason while the others added plenty of spicin ess . i highly recommend this meal . it deserves way more reviews . it is spicy hot as some noted but not overly so . if one does n't want it they could probably leave out the cayenne pepper . i think the c ayenne pepper makes it perfect however .	1

This was tasty but a bit too spicy. Next time I would not so much fresh taragon since it has a strong licorice flavor to it. I probably would opt for a spoon of it dry.

WOW! I can't believe there aren't more written reviews. I didn't have all of the herbs called for but used what I had and the stew was amazing. I also didn't have mushrooms so I just added a few more carrots and celery (including the celery leaves because they always add great flavor). It is definitely worth the stove time.	wow ! i ca n't believe there are n't more written reviews . i did n't have all of the herbs called for but used what i had and the stew was amazing . i also did n't have mushrooms so i just added a few more carrots and celery -lrb- including the celery leaves because they always add great flavor -rrb- . it is definitely worth the stove time .	1
I gave this 3 stars because the basics are there for a good dish but it's not good as written. For starters there is way way too much pepper and it overpowers everything else. The last time I was around someone using this much pepper they were heavy smokers and their taste buds were zilched. Start out by reducing the pepper asked to 1/2 or 1/3 and increase or reduce it from there next time. If you try to rush the dish and not let it simmer to thicken then it will turn out very runny. I substitute frozen bisquits and they work out just fine and I like the flavor better than canned biscuits.	i gave this 3 stars because the basics are there for a good dish but it 's not good as written . for starters there is way way too much pepper and it overpowers everything else . the last time i was arou nd someone using this much pepper they were heavy smokers and their taste buds were zilched . start out by reducing the pepper asked to 1/2 or 1/3 and increase or reduce it from there next time . if you try to rush the dish and not let it simmer to thicken then it will turn out very runny . i substitute frozen bisquits and they work out just fine and i like the flavor better than canned biscuits .	1
I am just so happy I found and tried this recipe. It is flavourful and delicious. A warning to those about to make it it is a tad bit spicey. I am not one for spicey foods but I still loved this. Next time I will tone it down with the peppers. I think it is a must to use all the spices otherwise you will lose some of the flavor. I cannot wait to make this again. I should mention I don't own a dutch oven so those like me can use a stock pot and then throw it all in a roaster when it is time to place in the oven. Works just the same.

Comfort food times ten. I did a double take when I saw the ingredient amounts for the herbs and spices. After reading through other reviews I checked the amounts for this recipe on Chef John s website. They were the same. Made the decision to halve them and am glad I did. Was a terrific combination and still had plenty of punch. For the liquid used half homemade stock and half water. I think next time I ll add an additional piece of carrot and celery.	comfort food times ten . i did a double take when i saw the ingredient amounts for the herbs and spices . after reading through other reviews i checked the amounts for this recipe on chef john s website . they were the same . made the decision to halve them and am glad i did . was a terrific combination and still had plenty of punch . for the liquid used half homemade stock and half water . i think next time i ll add an additional piece of carrot and celery .	1

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe. The dressing is lacking something maybe more brown sugar lime and ginger and a little oil? Also the dressing just runs to the bottom of the bowl the noodles didn't soak up the dressing even after having sat in the refrigerator overnight. (Another reviewer suggested some peanut butter in the dressing which is an excellent idea.) It is a difficult salad to plate and eat with the noodles being so long - I would break up the noodles a little before soaking them. I did serve this with grilled chicken but I used the recipe for Shoyu Chicken for the marinade for the chicken.	i was a bit disappointed with this recipe . the dressing is lacking something maybe more brown sugar lime and ginger and a little oil ? also the dressing just runs to the bottom of the bowl the noodles did n't soak up the dressing even after having sat in the refrigerator overnight . -lrb- another reviewer suggested some peanut butter in the dressing which is an excellent idea . -rrb- it is a difficult salad to plate and eat with the noodles being so long - i would break up the noodles a little before soaking them . i did serve this with grilled chicken but i used the recipe for shoyu chicken for the marinade for the chicken .	1
Wowee was I popular at the barbecue on Sunday! I made this great salad - it's sooooo easy and delicious! I made as is but for one thing: I substituted diced green peppers for the green onions as my Boo hates onions but I put them on the side with some extra crushed peanuts so that people could add garnish to their own salads. This one is definitely a keeper.

I have loved this salad for years - thanks for the recipe. I find that tossing the noodles in the dressing them laying them out on a cookie sheet topped with the veggies makes mixing everything together well much easier. I also add a splash of toasted sesame oil to the soaking water - the noodles then don't stick together and drain off the water better.	i have loved this salad for years - thanks for the recipe . i find that tossing the noodles in the dressing them laying them out on a cookie sheet topped with the veggies makes mixing everything togeth er well much easier . i also add a splash of toasted sesame oil to the soaking water - the noodles then do n't stick together and drain off the water better .	1
I LOVED this salad! So refreshing on a hot summer day. The carrots give a nice crunch and some added texture. I love Asian food but I've never used fish sauce before and I was a bit apprehensive. However all of the flavors work together perfectly. Don't be afraid! I think this salad is going to be in heavy rotation this summer at my house. I will say the rice noodles took forever to soften just sitting in hot water so I ended up boiling them and then hitting them with cold water and it was fine.	i loved this salad ! so refreshing on a hot summer day . the carrots give a nice crunch and some added texture . i love asian food but i 've never used fish sauce before and i was a bit apprehensive . howe ver all of the flavors work together perfectly . do n't be afraid ! i think this salad is going to be in heavy rotation this summer at my house . i will say the rice noodles took forever to soften just si tting in hot water so i ended up boiling them and then hitting them with cold water and it was fine .	1
Even my picky husband liked this and I thought for sure he would not. I used Thai Sweet Chili sauce and since it was so sweet (and spicy) I left out the brown sugar which was a good call. I added matchstick cut cucumber and left out the mint. Hubby can't eat cilantro so I served it on the side along with extra crushed peanuts (don't skip the peanuts!!) the more the better. I grilled shrimp to top the salad which was a great variation.

The only reason I gave this recipe even 2 stars is due to the sauce which I tweaked a little even. Added some lemongrass more sesame oil and ginger. However the noodles did not soften in the hot water which is what I was leary about in the first place. I think rice noodles need to be in boiling water for a minute to soften correctly.	the only reason i gave this recipe even 2 stars is due to the sauce which i tweaked a little even . added some lemongrass more sesame oil and ginger . however the noodles did not soften in the hot water which is what i was leary about in the first place . i think rice noodles need to be in boiling water for a minute to soften correctly .	1
OH BOY!  This is REAL Chicken Gravy!   Don't be afraid to cook your roux - if needs to be cooked slowly to a blonde stage - like Chef John says it will smell like pie crust.   Good chicken stock makes a huge difference with this gravy.  I did add a pinch of cayenne pepper to the roux along with some white pepper.  Then proceeded as directed....taste tasted and added a bit more.  Will I make again?

I really enjoyed this recipe. I've never bought gravy mixes and have always tried my hand at homemade gravies but they've never come out this good. I've always used oil and never butter and I think that that makes all the difference. I didn't use cream as I did not have it and the gravy was just as good. I did add a little bit of whole milk though. I will definitely use this time and time again. I know it was good because my husband enjoyed it and he is picky picky picky!!

Excellent easy recipe. I didn't have the cream added just a touch of milk and a little bit (about a teaspoon) of cornstarch. I also added a few dried parsley flakes and a tiny bit of sage.

This is a good basic well-written recipe for gravy that will appeal to all those who either have never made gravy or who aren t confident preparing it. I used the drippings from a roasted turkey breast plus enough boxed chicken stock to make up the difference. The cream was a nice addition something I don t generally use. I didn t care for the light color of the gravy however particularly since I was using it for sliced roast turkey but a little dribble of Kitchen Bouquet fixed that right up.	this is a good basic well-written recipe for gravy that will appeal to all those who either have never made gravy or who aren t confident preparing it . i used the drippings from a roasted turkey breas t plus enough boxed chicken stock to make up the difference . the cream was a nice addition something i don t generally use . i didn t care for the light color of the gravy however particularly since i was using it for sliced roast turkey but a little dribble of kitchen bouquet fixed that right up .	1
Mmm amazing! So good with our roast chicken and mashed potatoes. My gravy wasn't getting thick at a simmer so I increased the heat and brought it to a low boil whisking constantly (this is how my mom does it) until it was thick to my liking then turned off the heat and added the cream s/p and cayenne. Thanks so much for the recipe:)	mmm amazing ! so good with our roast chicken and mashed potatoes . my gravy was n't getting thick at a simmer so i increased the heat and brought it to a low boil whisking constantly -lrb- this is how my mom does it -rrb- until it was thick to my liking then turned off the heat and added the cream s/p and cayenne . thanks so much for the recipe :-rrb-	1
This is similar to the old Fanny Farmer chicken pot pie gravy recipe. I add a touch of poultry seasoning to mine and a dash of nutmeg. I then pour it over roughly cubed chicken drained can of LeSeur peas carmelized onion pieces and well-cooked sliced carrots. A topping of Bisquick biscuits finishes it off with a sprinkling of grated parmesan cheese over the biscuits. There usually aren't any leftovers!	this is similar to the old fanny farmer chicken pot pie gravy recipe . i add a touch of poultry seasoning to mine and a dash of nutmeg . i then pour it over roughly cubed chicken drained can of leseur p eas carmelized onion pieces and well-cooked sliced carrots . a topping of bisquick biscuits finishes it off with a sprinkling of grated parmesan cheese over the biscuits . there usually are n't any lefto vers !	1
I was true to the recipe with the exception of using raisins instead of currants. The recipe is superb -- with a Moroccan or North African twist. Its blend of lamb spices almonds and currants (raisins) give it a mellow sweet crunchy and heady flavor. This is all offset by the juiciness of the cabbage roll braised slowly in a hint of tomato puree and silky chicken broth. It was a breeze to make using Chef John's tips for steaming the cabbage to remove the leaves plus his directions for shaping the meat into tiny loaves before stuffing and rolling the cabbage like a burrito.

Loved the flavor and texture of the rolls. Did a double batch and froze half. I did use a mix of white rice and wild rice. Made Baked Acorn Squash by Corwynn Darkholm (from this site) as a side.

Could if I could give this recipe a full 10 stars!  It was just the best stuffed cabbage rolls we have eaten - my only change was to use diced tomatoes instead of sauce.  I have it on the menu now for a once a month rotation.

Flavor is soooo good even without the currants (couldn't find them at the store). Careful not to overcrowd the pan! The rice was still firm-to-crunchy cause there wasn't enough room for the liquid to circulate. We still ate them up! Will be making again very soon.	flavor is soooo good even without the currants -lrb- could n't find them at the store -rrb- . careful not to overcrowd the pan ! the rice was still firm-to-crunchy cause there was n't enough room for the liquid to circulate . we still ate them up ! will be making again very soon .	1

I'm a stickler for following the recipe exactly so that it turns out right. I made this recipe and baked it at the recommended temperature and for the recommended time and the rice was NOT cooked through. The meat tasted fabulous but it was not edible because of the rice. In the past I have always precooked rice before adding it to cabbage rolls and I will do it that way if I ever make this recipe again.	i 'm a stickler for following the recipe exactly so that it turns out right . i made this recipe and baked it at the recommended temperature and for the recommended time and the rice was not cooked thro ugh . the meat tasted fabulous but it was not edible because of the rice . in the past i have always precooked rice before adding it to cabbage rolls and i will do it that way if i ever make this recipe again .	1
I'm rating this 4 stars but don't get me wrong, it's very addictive, just be sure everyone in your group loves blue cheese. I prefer the original Frank's recipe which is on this site. If I were to make this one again, I would use either the blue cheese dressing or fresh blue cheese, but not both. I personally thought it was a bit overwhelming. I've done it before with Ranch and the result was amazing.	i 'm rating this 4 stars but do n't get me wrong , it 's very addictive , just be sure everyone in your group loves blue cheese . i prefer the original frank 's recipe which is on this site . if i were to mak e this one again , i would use either the blue cheese dressing or fresh blue cheese , but not both . i personally thought it was a bit overwhelming . i 've done it before with ranch and the result was amaz ing .	2
I found a way to make EVERYONE happy! I made 1 1/2 recipes. With half of the mix I used pepper jack cheese blue cheese dressing and a scant 1/4C blue cheese crumbles. With the other I used cheddar/jack cheese ranch dressing and 1 tsp. of powdered ranch dressing mix. Served them side by side with some blue cheese crumbles to spoon on top as they chose. I did use low or reduced fat ingredients where I could but that's my personal take. HINT: Blue cheese can be pricey and extras spoil if you don't use it frequently. I always buy the amount I need at the salad bar in my local grocery. It's less expensive by the pound there and I don't end up with a lot of leftovers to worry about wasting.	i found a way to make everyone happy ! i made 1 1/2 recipes . with half of the mix i used pepper jack cheese blue cheese dressing and a scant 1/4 c blue cheese crumbles . with the other i used cheddar/jac k cheese ranch dressing and 1 tsp . of powdered ranch dressing mix . served them side by side with some blue cheese crumbles to spoon on top as they chose . i did use low or reduced fat ingredients where i could but that 's my personal take . hint : blue cheese can be pricey and extras spoil if you do n't use it frequently . i always buy the amount i need at the salad bar in my local grocery . it 's less ex pensive by the pound there and i do n't end up with a lot of leftovers to worry about wasting .	1
I made this dip back on Super Bowl Sunday for a potluck party and got mixed reviews. I am one who does definitely prefer bleu cheese to ranch on my buffalo style wings but it seems that not everyone has my good taste! The bleu cheese taste was a bit strong however but that may be because of the dressing that I use which is Bob's Big Boy brand. It is a very rich dressing. I may temper it by halving the bleu cheese dressing and adding in some ranch next time. Not sure. Anyway 5 stars because I loved it and I'm sure that it can be made a little less potent so as to please most everyone.	i made this dip back on super bowl sunday for a potluck party and got mixed reviews . i am one who does definitely prefer bleu cheese to ranch on my buffalo style wings but it seems that not everyone h as my good taste ! the bleu cheese taste was a bit strong however but that may be because of the dressing that i use which is bob 's big boy brand . it is a very rich dressing . i may temper it by halving the bleu cheese dressing and adding in some ranch next time . not sure . anyway 5 stars because i loved it and i 'm sure that it can be made a little less potent so as to please most everyone .	1

Made this for a family get-together and everyone raved about it. It's very addicting. Only thing I did different was to substitute ranch dressing for the blue cheese dressing (still used the blue cheese crumbles) and shred the chicken in a food processor rather than dicing it.

Liked by most adults despised by most teenagers! I brought some to an adult Superbowl party and served with celery and Chicken n Biscuit crackers and it was well received.

This dip turned out much spicier than I predicted. Some people really liked it but it was a bit too hot for others. I followed the suggestions of others and omitted the blue cheese crumbles (only used the blue cheese dressing). Next time I will cut the amount of hot sauce in half.	this dip turned out much spicier than i predicted . some people really liked it but it was a bit too hot for others . i followed the suggestions of others and omitted the blue cheese crumbles -lrb- only used the blue cheese dressing -rrb- . next time i will cut the amount of hot sauce in half .	1

This was a lot of work for very little return. I made it the day before and thought that the flavor would meld over night however it was rather bland not very clammy and because it was made with all cream cheese it was very stiff and hard to get out of the bowl. I had to use a knife so that people could put it on very stiff french bread rounds. Anything less tough than the french bread rounds would just crumble.	this was a lot of work for very little return . i made it the day before and thought that the flavor would meld over night however it was rather bland not very clammy and because it was made with all c ream cheese it was very stiff and hard to get out of the bowl . i had to use a knife so that people could put it on very stiff french bread rounds . anything less tough than the french bread rounds woul d just crumble .	1

The flavor of this dip was good (after I modified) but I could not taste a single bit of clam flavoring. I think the cream cheese and bacon overpowers the clams and clam juice. I added cayenne pepper and creole seasoning because it was so bland- despite the jalepeno. It was way too thick to dip out of a bowl- I had to spoon it into individual custard dishes for each person along with spreading knives. Disappointing.	the flavor of this dip was good -lrb- after i modified -rrb- but i could not taste a single bit of clam flavoring . i think the cream cheese and bacon overpowers the clams and clam juice . i added cayenne pepper and creole seasoning because it was so bland - despite the jalepeno . it was way too thick to dip out of a bowl - i had to spoon it into individual custard dishes for each person along with spreading kni ves . disappointing .	1

Ok so I grew up on Banquet frozen chicken a la king and my husband grew up on his dad's version of turkey a la king. I was hoping that 1) this would be close to what we grew up on and 2) that it would be phenomenal due to it being one of Chef John's recipes but after all the work to make it (no modifications other than used gluten free AP flour) and the resulting flavor I am disappointed. My husband said he would not want me to make it again and really I don't have any desire to. I served it over GF biscuits (figured toasted bread like in childhood was too plain for a meal that took this long to make). I really don't know what would make it be five stars. I guess I'll keep looking.	ok so i grew up on banquet frozen chicken a la king and my husband grew up on his dad 's version of turkey a la king . i was hoping that 1 -rrb- this would be close to what we grew up on and 2 -rrb- that it would be phenomenal due to it being one of chef john 's recipes but after all the work to make it -lrb- no modifications other than used gluten free ap flour -rrb- and the resulting flavor i am disappointed . my husba nd said he would not want me to make it again and really i do n't have any desire to . i served it over gf biscuits -lrb- figured toasted bread like in childhood was too plain for a meal that took this long to make -rrb- . i really do n't know what would make it be five stars . i guess i 'll keep looking .	1

Excellent recipe!  We made it as written and would caution that it is very spicy.   If you're using the recipe in burritos as we did, it's perfect as the other ingredients mellow out the heat.  If I were making it for tacos or another recipe that it was more front and center, I would reduce the amount of peppers by 1 or 2.  All that being said, we made burritos with rice, beans and cheese and then topped each one with a bit of the sauce and some more cheese and tossed them under the broiler for a minute and it was truly amazing.  Served it with a side of shredded lettuce, tomato,  onions and fresh guacamole and garnished with fresh cilantro and cotija cheese . Far better than anything you can get at a restaurant.	excellent recipe ! we made it as written and would caution that it is very spicy . if you 're using the recipe in burritos as we did , it 's perfect as the other ingredients mellow out the heat . if i w ere making it for tacos or another recipe that it was more front and center , i would reduce the amount of peppers by 1 or 2 . all that being said , we made burritos with rice , beans and cheese and then topped each one with a bit of the sauce and some more cheese and tossed them under the broiler for a minute and it was truly amazing . served it with a side of shredded lettuce , tomato , onions and f resh guacamole and garnished with fresh cilantro and cotija cheese . far better than anything you can get at a restaurant .	1
I'm not a big fan of chipotle peppers - but this recipe made me change my mind about that!! I made enchiladas with them and no one could get enough of them. I like that the recipe is pretty forgiving - if you cook the chicken too long it doesn't really matter because it's in a wonderful sauce that infuses the meat and keeps it moist.	i 'm not a big fan of chipotle peppers - but this recipe made me change my mind about that !! i made enchiladas with them and no one could get enough of them . i like that the recipe is pretty forgiving - if you cook the chicken too long it does n't really matter because it 's in a wonderful sauce that infuses the meat and keeps it moist .	1

I made this a few weeks ago and I'm getting ready to make it again this weekend. It was amazingly delicious. I first made the sauce in the blender with the entire can of chipotle peppers but when I tasted it directly from the blender I thought it was way too spicy. So I poured down half of it and added more tomatoes and it was still very spicy but more bearable. Even my son who refuses to eat chicken (only eats beef pork and seafood. I told him it was pork and confessed it was chicken after he ate it) loved it. We made tacos.

4 1/2 Stars- but I'll round up! Seriously one of the best Asian Chicken recipes I've ever made. The chicken was a perfect combination of sweet and spicy, the 1/2 star I took off was because I found the recipe a bit too salty.  I'm sure this will probably vary depending on the brands of soy/fish sauce you use.  I would start light on both then add if needed.  I made half a recipe for my boyfriend and I with a side of sesame green beans and brown rice. I was worried it wouldn't be enough food as I only had 3 chicken thighs, but it was perfect, if not too much food.  I had no troubles with the liquid ratio, but I did have a big pan with not much meat (and a gas stove). I would tend to think that maybe the people who are having trouble may be overcrowding the pan.  All in all this is a wow-worthy recipe, definitely suitable for company.

I am ONLY reviewing the sauce because I went in a different direction with my chicken. I used rotisserie chicken thighs and French cut green beans and almonds. I made the sauce exactly as written and just reduced it down, then added my chicken, green beans and almonds to heat through. Served over brown Jasmine rice with egg rolls on the side. The sauce is *wonderful* and would be good on just about any Asian-inspired sauce you chose to use it in. I will definitely make this again, maybe even as written sometime!

Thank you Chef John.  I followed your recipe exactly, except that I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken (not a fan of bones), and my husband said that this was the best chicken ever.  We eat a lot of different chicken breast recipes, so that says a lot.	thank you chef john . i followed your recipe exactly , except that i used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken -lrb- not a fan of bones -rrb- , and my husband said that this was the best chicken ever . we e at a lot of different chicken breast recipes , so that says a lot .	1
Such a nice change from other grilled chicken and so healthy.  You can do this marinade with any type of chicken (ie: boneless, skinless breasts or thighs).  I didn't even marinate it for more than 1 1/2 hours and it was still delicious! The yogurt harissa (hot sauce) mixture is great with the chicken.  I served this chicken with coleslaw.	such a nice change from other grilled chicken and so healthy . you can do this marinade with any type of chicken -lrb- ie : boneless , skinless breasts or thighs -rrb- . i did n't even marinate it for more than 1 1/2 hours and it was still delicious ! the yogurt harissa -lrb- hot sauce -rrb- mixture is great with the chicken . i served this chicken with coleslaw .	1
Outstanding. Greeks and Indians famous for using natural live yogurt for moisture and tenderization. Good flavors though I'd add onion. Sidebar: My Mother would use yogurt instead of buttermilk (We made our own yogurt) sometimes to marinate her chicken for frying Southern (OK Southern Armenian) style. Worked like a charm.

this is very good! i kept the recipe the same except using chicken breast and adding some extra rosemary which goes so well with lemon and chicken. i also chose not to make the dipping sauce.. doesn't really need it. very fresh tasting and light. i will make this again.	this is very good ! i kept the recipe the same except using chicken breast and adding some extra rosemary which goes so well with lemon and chicken . i also chose not to make the dipping sauce . . does n't really need it . very fresh tasting and light . i will make this again .	1

Simply amazing!! I even almost screwed this up on accident by forgetting to brown the chicken in the oil and butter and started to reduce the liquid when I realized oh I missed a step. This is hands down the best chicken recipe I have ever tried! My husband was so impressed that I think I am going to have to make it again tomorrow so my parsley doesn't go bad! The lemon is amazing in the dish if you put the right amount of butter in it. I am addicted to this chicken just can't get over that flavor. Thanks Chef John your recipes never fail.	simply amazing !! i even almost screwed this up on accident by forgetting to brown the chicken in the oil and butter and started to reduce the liquid when i realized oh i missed a step . this is hands d own the best chicken recipe i have ever tried ! my husband was so impressed that i think i am going to have to make it again tomorrow so my parsley does n't go bad ! the lemon is amazing in the dish if y ou put the right amount of butter in it . i am addicted to this chicken just ca n't get over that flavor . thanks chef john your recipes never fail .	1
Wow! This was great and super easy! I did make a few changes but nothing drastic. I omitted the milk and added some chopped parsley in with the egg so the parsley was actually on the chicken. I used dry white wine instead of the sherry and chicken broth instead of veggie. I don't think the changes I made would make huge taste differences so yes this is another 5 star recipe for sure!

My family has always loved roast chicken so I have made it for years. This recipe is the best I have ever made. The chicken was very juicy and so tender. I even made the sauce and could not believe how good it was and how incredibly simple it was to make. I was out of lemons so I substituted white wine vinegar and it was terrific!

I made this with an organic whole chicken and my picky family raved over it! Juicy crispy crust and not a salty taste. Be sure to brush excess salt off the bird before cutting and plating so it doesn't get into the rest of your meal.	i made this with an organic whole chicken and my picky family raved over it ! juicy crispy crust and not a salty taste . be sure to brush excess salt off the bird before cutting and plating so it doesn ' t get into the rest of your meal .	1
We really enjoyed this chicken! I love making whole chickens and do so at least twice a month. This recipe was a nice change up from my usual rosemary and garlic roasted bird. It did turn out rather salty and I used coarse ground kosher salt - but it wasn't inedible salty. (and of course I expected it to be salty!) I prepared this in my infrared oven which I believe helped the skin to crisp very nicely. The whole thing was a beautiful uniform golden color. My husband teenage daughter and I loved the sauce but my young children didn't care for the lemon flavor of it so next time I will try making it with white wine in place of the lemon juice. This recipe is a keeper that I will make again and again.	we really enjoyed this chicken ! i love making whole chickens and do so at least twice a month . this recipe was a nice change up from my usual rosemary and garlic roasted bird . it did turn out rather s alty and i used coarse ground kosher salt - but it was n't inedible salty . -lrb- and of course i expected it to be salty ! -rrb- i prepared this in my infrared oven which i believe helped the skin to crisp very n icely . the whole thing was a beautiful uniform golden color . my husband teenage daughter and i loved the sauce but my young children did n't care for the lemon flavor of it so next time i will try maki ng it with white wine in place of the lemon juice . this recipe is a keeper that i will make again and again .	1

well I really mucked this recipe...I used sea salt instead of Kosher--didn't think it would make that much of a difference but it did. The chicken came out greasy and way to salty tasting and the jus is inedible. Sorry Chef-will try again using kosher next time! I don't think it is proper to give this recipe a rating until I follow it exactly so I will give it a 3 for now.	well i really mucked this recipe ... i used sea salt instead of kosher -- did n't think it would make that much of a difference but it did . the chicken came out greasy and way to salty tasting and the jus is inedible . sorry chef-will try again using kosher next time ! i do n't think it is proper to give this recipe a rating until i follow it exactly so i will give it a 3 for now .	1

These burgers were delicious. Make the peanut sauce just before serving as a chemical reaction occurs and the spread got very thick and was quite difficult to spread but still tasted great.

These burgers are a delicious healthier version of comfort food. I used 1/2 ground chicken and 1/2 ground turkey to decrease the cost. I also added an egg to bind the meat mixture.

This was dinner tonight and it was SO GOOD! I suspect the mascarpone cheese might hold some people back from making it. I wanted to include it but couldn't get to the store so I whipped together cream cheese and some kefir and it worked just fine!

this recipe is very good and very similar to the one done at my mother's home in Sicily. Only difference, we cook the pasta in the same water the broccoli have been cooked in to give it extra flavor and stir fry some sun dried tomatoes and/or a few anchovies fillets with the garlic. We usually don't top it with parmesan but with roasted breadcrumbs.	this recipe is very good and very similar to the one done at my mother 's home in sicily . only difference , we cook the pasta in the same water the broccoli have been cooked in to give it extra flavor a nd stir fry some sun dried tomatoes and/or a few anchovies fillets with the garlic . we usually do n't top it with parmesan but with roasted breadcrumbs .	1
This is a great recipe that I grew up eating and still make it often just last week as a matter of fact! I prefer to use Spaghetti Rigati or Thin Spaghetti. I usually just eyeball the recipe but Chef John's measurements are spot on. I do add some freshly ground black pepper and sometimes I change it up by adding caramelized onion. Last week I added the onion and also bacon that I chopped finely and crisped and sauteed the onion garlic and stems using a bit of the bacon grease along with the oil and butter. That was a tasty variation. Another variation that I have made one that might not appeal to everyone is to cook the florets until they are very soft and mashing the broccoli/garlic and onions into the stock leaving some of the broccoli in small chunks. This method makes it more of a sauce that will cling to the pasta. Alternately you can also set aside some florets to cook tender crisp so that you have the best of both worlds! For Chrissy yes you can use frozen broccoli but the cooking time will have to be adjusted. I would let the broccoli thaw first and then proceed with the recipe. Hope this helps!	this is a great recipe that i grew up eating and still make it often just last week as a matter of fact ! i prefer to use spaghetti rigati or thin spaghetti . i usually just eyeball the recipe but chef john 's measurements are spot on . i do add some freshly ground black pepper and sometimes i change it up by adding caramelized onion . last week i added the onion and also bacon that i chopped finely an d crisped and sauteed the onion garlic and stems using a bit of the bacon grease along with the oil and butter . that was a tasty variation . another variation that i have made one that might not appeal to everyone is to cook the florets until they are very soft and mashing the broccoli/garlic and onions into the stock leaving some of the broccoli in small chunks . this method makes it more of a sauc e that will cling to the pasta . alternately you can also set aside some florets to cook tender crisp so that you have the best of both worlds ! for chrissy yes you can use frozen broccoli but the cooki ng time will have to be adjusted . i would let the broccoli thaw first and then proceed with the recipe . hope this helps !	1
Delicious!  I added a few meatballs on top to make this a main dish.  Also added a squeeze of lemon at the end.  Be sure to undercook your broccoli and your pasta.  They will both finish cooking in the pot at the end.  If it seems too runny, place on stovetop for another minute until broth cooks off.	delicious ! i added a few meatballs on top to make this a main dish . also added a squeeze of lemon at the end . be sure to undercook your broccoli and your pasta . they will both finish cooking in th e pot at the end . if it seems too runny , place on stovetop for another minute until broth cooks off .	1

I can never get these garlic/oil recipes right! I thought this one would be different with having broth. I ended up with a soup like broth. My only change was adding in some sautéed mushrooms. I can't imagine it adding that much liquid! I finally ended up adding some half and half at the end to change it up and see if that would thicken the consistency. It did nothing. I ended up with white broth. On taste and texture I would rate it about a 2. Being as I have never succeeded at one of these recipes I rated it 1 star higher. Maybe someone will eat it.	i can never get these garlic/oil recipes right ! i thought this one would be different with having broth . i ended up with a soup like broth . my only change was adding in some sautéed mushrooms . i ca n't imagine it adding that much liquid ! i finally ended up adding some half and half at the end to change it up and see if that would thicken the consistency . it did nothing . i ended up with white broth . on taste and texture i would rate it about a 2 . being as i have never succeeded at one of these recipes i rated it 1 star higher . maybe someone will eat it .	1

Since I'm a vegetarian, I substituted firm tofu for the chicken. I cooked the tofu per instructions but didn't add it back to the pot with the stock until almost ready for serving.  Also, I used coconut milk and cut the stock down by 12 oz.  Didn't have zucchini; used fresh green beans instead as well as 1 cup pumpkin puree to firm it up.  Didn't have fresh peanuts or cilantro but it didn't matter.  Served the stew over cooked spaghetti squash.  It was filling and delicious.	since i 'm a vegetarian , i substituted firm tofu for the chicken . i cooked the tofu per instructions but did n't add it back to the pot with the stock until almost ready for serving . also , i used cocon ut milk and cut the stock down by 12 oz . did n't have zucchini ; used fresh green beans instead as well as 1 cup pumpkin puree to firm it up . did n't have fresh peanuts or cilantro but it did n't matter . served the stew over cooked spaghetti squash . it was filling and delicious .	1

As a huge fan of Chef John, I'm always willing to try a recipe he posts. This one, while certainly good, wasn't a big hit here. I was actually very surprised, (given the ingredients), that this wasn't more flavorful. Since it's from Chef John, I'll try making it again before deleting it from my favorites, but may make a few adjustments to spice things up.	as a huge fan of chef john , i 'm always willing to try a recipe he posts . this one , while certainly good , was n't a big hit here . i was actually very surprised , -lrb- given the ingredients -rrb- , that this was n't more flavorful . since it 's from chef john , i 'll try making it again before deleting it from my favorites , but may make a few adjustments to spice things up .	1

Extremely good except for the fact that I had to thicken my sauce much longer than anticipated. The amount of chicken stock to add should be halved as should the parsley amount.

I decided to make this with some homemade pasta & it tasted just like the one we get at our favorite Italian restaurant!

I am not an experienced cook. One of the primary reasons I love Chef John's recipes is that even someone like me  can still do them justice. I attempted to follow the directions exactly as outlined. Having never roasted peppers before, mine came out a little too crispy in the end. I believe this was my error and should have only halved my peppers rather than quartering. I sliced he onions as suggested and they burned to a crisp. I guess this is where my inexperience comes in. The chicken was perfect. Crispy skin but still moist and tender. I used Hot Italian sausage and that also came out beautifully and some of the heat made it's way into the chicken. All in all, loved this dish and will make it again. I will either add the onions later or maybe skip them altogether and have more of the sweet peppers.

This was simple and tasted great. I asked my wife before cooking it if she wanted any, and she declined, telling me to cut the recipe in half so I wouldn't have excessive leftovers. As it was roasting she was drawn to the kitchen and remarked that it smelled good. She returned later asking when it would be ready and did I make enough for her after all. When she saw it, she said it looked beautiful, and after eating it raved about how much she loved it. Oh, and I loved it too. I might add whole heirloom carrots next time and experiment around with red potatoes or something just for fun, but still great just as it is.	this was simple and tasted great . i asked my wife before cooking it if she wanted any , and she declined , telling me to cut the recipe in half so i would n't have excessive leftovers . as it was roasting she was drawn to the kitchen and remarked that it smelled good . she returned later asking when it would be ready and did i make enough for her after all . when she saw it , she said it looked beautiful , and after eating it raved about how much she loved it . oh , and i loved it too . i might add whole heirloom carrots next time and experiment around with red potatoes or something just for fun , but sti ll great just as it is .	1
This is divine!! My husband who rarely gives out compliments adored it. Definitely use a gorgeous Italian sausage. I don't know if Chef John intended using precooked or smoked types. The flavor from the sausage took this dish to decedent. And additional or various other veggies that work well roasted would make it even better. They're supposed to get a bit black (esp. sweet peppers) or brown and crisp. That's the goal. Then they're sweet and lovely. This dish is very easy short on time needed to preprep and really elegant. Great with crusty bread or a good green salad. Thanks John.	this is divine !! my husband who rarely gives out compliments adored it . definitely use a gorgeous italian sausage . i do n't know if chef john intended using precooked or smoked types . the flavor from t he sausage took this dish to decedent . and additional or various other veggies that work well roasted would make it even better . they 're supposed to get a bit black -lrb- esp . sweet peppers -rrb- or brown and c risp . that 's the goal . then they 're sweet and lovely . this dish is very easy short on time needed to preprep and really elegant . great with crusty bread or a good green salad . thanks john .	1
We LOVE this recipe. It is great when you have a crowd to feed. I generally don t brown the sausage ahead of time as I find it browns up just fine in the pan (and I use mild sausage so I don t get that oil anyway).

I rarely leave reviews but with this recipe I had to make an exception. First of all thank you Chef John. For everyone else. You REALLY need to try this recipe. I made it according to the directions but cut it down to 4 servings. I used two sweet & one hot Italian sausage. The next time (there WILL be a next time) I think I ll just try three spicy sausages. I used one large red bell pepper but I m thinkin you could use any kind of peppers or a combination of peppers including some spicy ones if you like it that way.	i rarely leave reviews but with this recipe i had to make an exception . first of all thank you chef john . for everyone else . you really need to try this recipe . i made it according to the directions b ut cut it down to 4 servings . i used two sweet & one hot italian sausage . the next time -lrb- there will be a next time -rrb- i think i ll just try three spicy sausages . i used one large red bell pepper but i m thinkin you could use any kind of peppers or a combination of peppers including some spicy ones if you like it that way .	1
Take my advice... watch chef John's video and make it exactly the way he tells you I can't stop eating this!! So delicious and simple and flavorful. You HAVE to use spicy sausage though sweet sausage doesn't give it that kick like the spicy does just cut them to 1-inch slices instead of two because wow it's spicy. Be generous with the salt but two teaspoons is a bit much. I kinda eyeballed it. I wish my supermarket sold organic chicken thighs skin on and bone in but I made an exception because I didn't want to sacrifice the flavor. Bon appetit!!	take my advice ... watch chef john 's video and make it exactly the way he tells you i ca n't stop eating this !! so delicious and simple and flavorful . you have to use spicy sausage though sweet sausage does n't give it that kick like the spicy does just cut them to 1 inch slices instead of two because wow it 's spicy . be generous with the salt but two teaspoons is a bit much . i kinda eyeballed it . i w ish my supermarket sold organic chicken thighs skin on and bone in but i made an exception because i did n't want to sacrifice the flavor . bon appetit !!	1

This was okay. Followed the recipe except I used mild Italian sausage because my husband doesn't like hot. In the end the chicken tasted just like chicken potatoes tasted just like potatoes and so on. Everything was moist but heavy on grease and oil.

Not for the faint of heart. The chicken is extremely spicy.

Very very good. What I like most about this 'company worthy' dish is that it can be prepped entirely ahead of time cooked to order and looks fabulous. BUT it really very easy.

I made this as a dinner to take to my fiancée at work. I was a little worried about the crusty bread crumb top getting soggy in transport since I had to cover it but that didn t turn out to be a problem at all. The bread crumbs stayed nice and crisp and had all of that awesome flavor packed in. The only problem I ran into was that the chicken turned out to be a little tough but I think that was more of a problem with the quality of the chicken breast more so than the person preparing it. Why take responsibility when you really don t have to? I think next time I ll pound the chicken down a bit and hopefully that ll tenderize the meat a little. Overall it got rave reviews and my fiancée is still committed to me so I suppose this recipe was a win.	i made this as a dinner to take to my fiancée at work . i was a little worried about the crusty bread crumb top getting soggy in transport since i had to cover it but that didn t turn out to be a probl em at all . the bread crumbs stayed nice and crisp and had all of that awesome flavor packed in . the only problem i ran into was that the chicken turned out to be a little tough but i think that was mo re of a problem with the quality of the chicken breast more so than the person preparing it . why take responsibility when you really don t have to ? i think next time i ll pound the chicken down a bit and hopefully that ll tenderize the meat a little . overall it got rave reviews and my fiancée is still committed to me so i suppose this recipe was a win .	1

This was delicious! I followed the recipe as written except for doubling it to serve 4 people and adding garlic powder to the seasoning for the chicken. The breadcrumbs are really the star of this dish because they taste great (the cheese gives them a lot of flavor) and they add wonderful texture. I forgot to double the sauce recipe so there was only a little bit for each cutlet but it was still quite tasty and I'm sure it would be even better with the full amount.

This recipe was very good! I will be making it again spouse loved it. The only thing I would do differently is maybe not so much garlic. Now garlic cloves as we all know come in all different sizes.

I love this stuffing! This is the second time I've made this and it turned out awesome. Make sure to use a large stock pot to cook the wild rice in because you end up adding a lot more to the pot later on. For the herbs I used 1 Tbsp. rosemary 2 Tbsp. basil 1 Tbsp. oregano 1 Tbsp. thyme 1/2 Tbsp. marjoram and 1/2 tsp. ground sage. I also added 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper. The great thing is you can adjust the herbs according to your tastes. To cut costs I only used raisins and craisins (skipping the apricots and cherries).

I purchased a long grain and wild rice combination and just cooked it up acocrding to the package directions. I used microwave bacon (I hate bacon grease) and set it aside. I sauteed the onion and celery and added the fruit to the rice while the rice was still a little 'wet'. Added the celery and onion the dry herb mix (basil organo thyme sage) to the rice and fruit and cooked on med-low until everything was cooked through. Added the bacon and parley and mixed until warm. This is an incredible dish.

The instructions for the recipe are not written correctly omitting the broth that is called for in the ingredients list. The uncooked long grain rice do not soften in the time instructed. I think this would be a great recipe if the long grain were pre-cooked and then mixed into the other ingredients. The flavor was good the texture was crunchy. No one would eat it at Thanksgiving.	the instructions for the recipe are not written correctly omitting the broth that is called for in the ingredients list . the uncooked long grain rice do not soften in the time instructed . i think this would be a great recipe if the long grain were pre-cooked and then mixed into the other ingredients . the flavor was good the texture was crunchy . no one would eat it at thanksgiving .	1

Fantastic! My only variations are to use 8 large chicken thighs (skin on to reduce prep and cleanup time) substitute a dry red wine for the water and use 1 cup of Barilla Marinara for the tomato sauce. NOTE: after browning all the thighs it s a good idea to drain most of the fat before proceeding. I serve over buttered wide egg noodles.	fantastic ! my only variations are to use 8 large chicken thighs -lrb- skin on to reduce prep and cleanup time -rrb- substitute a dry red wine for the water and use 1 cup of barilla marinara for the tomato sauce . note : after browning all the thighs it s a good idea to drain most of the fat before proceeding . i serve over buttered wide egg noodles .	1

Very good! Used my homemade sauce. I always make a big batch & freeze it in 2 cup batches so I'm always ready when I get the urge to cook. I too spiced it up a little more. Had 2 zucchini that were just about ready for zucchini heaven so I threw them in too slced of course.

I made this as written except I used chicken thighs. In the video, I thought he said to keep all the chicken run-off after browning. I wish I would have stuck with my mind and drained it.

My oh my! This is some insanely delectable fried chicken!! Now I've tried some really great fried chicken in my time but this takes the cake! Crispy crunchy flavorful yummy goodness. This is the BEST fried chicken I've ever made. (Makes me almost feel like a professional cook although far from it. Lol) And my kids absolutely LOVE this! (And I have a super picky eater on my hands) It's to die for with the Korean Fried Chicken Sauce but still equally as good without. I personally prefer it with the sauce as it's nice and spicy. And face it we could all use a little spice in our lives.:-) This will definitely be my go-to fried chicken recipe from now on. I know some people might think this is a bit time consuming to have to fry this in two steps but believe me when I say the effort is totally worth it!! I'd give this 10 stars if I could!!	my oh my ! this is some insanely delectable fried chicken !! now i 've tried some really great fried chicken in my time but this takes the cake ! crispy crunchy flavorful yummy goodness . this is the best fried chicken i 've ever made . -lrb- makes me almost feel like a professional cook although far from it . lol -rrb- and my kids absolutely love this ! -lrb- and i have a super picky eater on my hands -rrb- it 's to die for w ith the korean fried chicken sauce but still equally as good without . i personally prefer it with the sauce as it 's nice and spicy . and face it we could all use a little spice in our lives. :--rrb- this wi ll definitely be my go-to fried chicken recipe from now on . i know some people might think this is a bit time consuming to have to fry this in two steps but believe me when i say the effort is totally worth it !! i 'd give this 10 stars if i could !!	1
I am making this again for the second time in a matter of weeks. My family just loved it and the sauce. I didn't have a deep fryer so I used my good ole' heavy skillet. At first I was put off because the chicken once battered stuck to the bottom of the skillet but I figured out that I needed to turn it once intially after a few seconds and it came out great! I am making it for Easter dinner at my family's request! Watch the video it is very helpful. At first I thought it was just regular hard fried chicken but I was wrong. The flavors came together so well. Try it it will soon be a family fav.	i am making this again for the second time in a matter of weeks . my family just loved it and the sauce . i did n't have a deep fryer so i used my good ole ' heavy skillet . at first i was put off because the chicken once battered stuck to the bottom of the skillet but i figured out that i needed to turn it once intially after a few seconds and it came out great ! i am making it for easter dinner at my family 's request ! watch the video it is very helpful . at first i thought it was just regular hard fried chicken but i was wrong . the flavors came together so well . try it it will soon be a family fav .	1

Best ever fried chicken! Light, crispy, juicy chicken sure to please everyone! I added a tiny bit more salt and pepper for personal preference only. Fried in deep cast iron  skillet with peanut oil. One large bl/sl chicken breast cut into 4ths and two thighs cut in half each. 3 to 4 mins.  per side. Next time I will use remaining batter for onion rings, zucchini, etc. Almost tempura-like. Great recipe, Chef John! Thank you!	best ever fried chicken ! light , crispy , juicy chicken sure to please everyone ! i added a tiny bit more salt and pepper for personal preference only . fried in deep cast iron skillet with peanut oil . o ne large bl/sl chicken breast cut into 4 ths and two thighs cut in half each . 3 to 4 mins . per side . next time i will use remaining batter for onion rings , zucchini , etc. . almost tempura-like . great re cipe , chef john ! thank you !	1
Chef John (note the chef title) is able to fry a large chicken breast without it turning black.  I, however, know my limitations.   I decided to cut the breast into medallions to enhance my chances of having a dish that was edible.  Other than that slight change, I made the recipe exactly as instructed.  This is a great recipe.  The chicken had wonderful flavor was very moist and absolutely perfect served on greens.  This is a keeper.	chef john -lrb- note the chef title -rrb- is able to fry a large chicken breast without it turning black . i , however , know my limitations . i decided to cut the breast into medallions to enhance my chances of having a dish that was edible . other than that slight change , i made the recipe exactly as instructed . this is a great recipe . the chicken had wonderful flavor was very moist and absolutely perfec t served on greens . this is a keeper .	1

DEFINATELY 5/5. This was my very first attempt at fried chicken and it was phenomenal! Everyone (boyfriend/fiance parents and little sister) polished it off before anyone had time to get seconds. The only thing I will criticize is that it was indeed a little salty but I used onion powder instead of onion salt. Regardless this was VERY good and went well with the carrots and dinner rolls we had with it. I will most definately make this again.:D	definately 5/5 . this was my very first attempt at fried chicken and it was phenomenal ! everyone -lrb- boyfriend/fiance parents and little sister -rrb- polished it off before anyone had time to get seconds . the only thing i will criticize is that it was indeed a little salty but i used onion powder instead of onion salt . regardless this was very good and went well with the carrots and dinner rolls we had wit h it . i will most definately make this again. :d	1
Wow! This was wonderful. I followed exactly with the exception of substituting half-and-half for the buttermilk (I had some I wanted to use up). I was a little afraid I would burn them to a crisp as my chicken breasts were pretty big but I just turned them a couple of times and they turned out well. This is definitely a keeper!

For all of the prep time and messing with frying the result was moist chicken with a bland coating. Not worth repeating.	for all of the prep time and messing with frying the result was moist chicken with a bland coating . not worth repeating .	1
Talk about great FLAVOR - this is it! Chef John has done it again. Perfect as written no need to change a thing. As I was making this I was second guessing the recipe - 'Maybe I should brown the chicken....' etc...etc... I decided to trust the recipe and I am so glad I did. One comment - there is a lot of chicken fat that needs to be skimmed off. If making this for company I would make the whole thing the day before - remove the chicken and vegetables - skim off as much fat as possible and refrigerate it - then skim off more fat once it had thoroughly chilled. Re-heat on low - make the rice and you have a wonderful flavorful easy meal. NOTE: You can use chicken pieces in this but they need to be bone in skin on to give this dish that extra flavor. Remove the skin and bones prior to adding the chicken back into the sauce. Thanks Chef John for another keeper to add into the rotation.	talk about great flavor - this is it ! chef john has done it again . perfect as written no need to change a thing . as i was making this i was second guessing the recipe - ` maybe i should brown the chick en ...

People watch to video. Chef Johns says the sour cream will break and curdle and shows how to fix that. It also clearly shows the chicken is only half submerged in the liquid. That is why you turn it over. Please don't knock a recipe because you didn't do it correctly! This is great. Just know what you are supposed to do before you start cooking.	people watch to video . chef johns says the sour cream will break and curdle and shows how to fix that . it also clearly shows the chicken is only half submerged in the liquid . that is why you turn it o ver . please do n't knock a recipe because you did n't do it correctly ! this is great . just know what you are supposed to do before you start cooking .	1
Oh my goodness, this is one of the best meals I've ever made! I used 4 chicken legs with the thighs attached because I didn't want to take a whole chicken out and cut it up. It cooked faster, about 1 hour. Also, I was worried it would be too spicy for my kids, so I only added 1 jalapeño. It gave nice flavor, but no spice at all, so if you like a little zip I don't think both jalapeños and the cayenne pepper would be too much at all. I will put them all in next time. Amazing & awesome! Thank you for a great recipe!	oh my goodness , this is one of the best meals i 've ever made ! i used 4 chicken legs with the thighs attached because i did n't want to take a whole chicken out and cut it up . it cooked faster , about 1 hour . also , i was worried it would be too spicy for my kids , so i only added 1 jalapeño . it gave nice flavor , but no spice at all , so if you like a little zip i do n't think both jalapeños and the caye nne pepper would be too much at all . i will put them all in next time . amazing & awesome ! thank you for a great recipe !	1
Prepared as recipe stated but had two problems. The recipe listed sour cream as an option which I used; however this separated even though I did not even bring it to a boil. Very unappealing to the eye. Secondly with the liquid listed my chicken was not even close to submerged. I did add one more cup of liquid and equivalent spices so that the liquid was close to the top of the chicken. Flavor was good but did not look good.	prepared as recipe stated but had two problems . the recipe listed sour cream as an option which i used ; however this separated even though i did not even bring it to a boil . very unappealing to the ey e. secondly with the liquid listed my chicken was not even close to submerged . i did add one more cup of liquid and equivalent spices so that the liquid was close to the top of the chicken . flavor was good but did not look good .	1
Oh! MY! I made this recipe for dinner tonight and it was absolutely delicious! I recommend highly that you try this recipe. At first I thought that it was going to be too spicy with the jalapeños but surprisingly it was mild. I am not lying this was restaurant good! And easy to make!

This was delicious. I wanted a lower fat version so I used 2 1/2 lbs of Chicken Tenders instead of the whole chicken. I did not give up the sour cream yet by using skinless breasts it did eliminate a good bit of the fat calories and this dish was still amazing. I used roasted jarred red peppers. I added the cilantro toward the end so that the fresh flavor was not cooked out of it. I did not add the sour cream until I had taken the chicken out of the broth at the very end just before serving. I could see that the broth was very thin and I desired it thicker so I mixed 1/4c of Wondra flour into the sour cream making sure that the flour and sour cream were well mixed before I added it....did not want any flour lumps. I then added the mixture to the broth at a low temp and mixed until it thickened. It came out beautifully thickened and the sour cream sauce stayed perfect. Be patient with the thickening at the lower temperature....you do NOT want to boil the sour cream or it will separate.	this was delicious . i wanted a lower fat version so i used 2 1/2 lbs of chicken tenders instead of the whole chicken . i did not give up the sour cream yet by using skinless breasts it did eliminate a good bit of the fat calories and this dish was still amazing . i used roasted jarred red peppers . i added the cilantro toward the end so that the fresh flavor was not cooked out of it . i did not add th e sour cream until i had taken the chicken out of the broth at the very end just before serving . i could see that the broth was very thin and i desired it thicker so i mixed 1/4 c of wondra flour into the sour cream making sure that the flour and sour cream were well mixed before i added it ... did not want any flour lumps . i then added the mixture to the broth at a low temp and mixed until it thick ened . it came out beautifully thickened and the sour cream sauce stayed perfect . be patient with the thickening at the lower temperature ... you do not want to boil the sour cream or it will separate .	1
This Teriyaki is pretty good but would be even better with a couple of cloves of minced garlic. I would double or triple the ginger too. Broiling worked well I used Reynold's non stick foil (love that stuff) but I think actually grilling the chicken would have been even better. Chicken thighs are pretty thin and cook really fast. I didn't get the 'finish' I would have liked using the broiler. Grilling over direct heat and glazing the entire time would have been easier and produced a better glazed finish to the chicken without over cooking it.	this teriyaki is pretty good but would be even better with a couple of cloves of minced garlic . i would double or triple the ginger too . broiling worked well i used reynold 's non stick foil -lrb- love that stuff -rrb- but i think actually grilling the chicken would have been even better . chicken thighs are pretty thin and cook really fast . i did n't get the ` finish ' i would have liked using the broiler . gril ling over direct heat and glazing the entire time would have been easier and produced a better glazed finish to the chicken without over cooking it .	1
I tried this last night. My n-laws were in town so I wanted to cook something tasty. I wanted to cook something similar to Yakitori which is Japanese dish. If you would put small bite size of chickens and good size of green onion chunks and put them in a skewer alternately and then glaze and cook them. I'm sure that would be a hit.	i tried this last night . my n-laws were in town so i wanted to cook something tasty . i wanted to cook something similar to yakitori which is japanese dish . if you would put small bite size of chickens and good size of green onion chunks and put them in a skewer alternately and then glaze and cook them . i 'm sure that would be a hit .	1
I always read a few reviews before I make something so I added garlic and increased the ginger as one reviewer suggested because I love garlic and I find that most recipes need more spice than called for (at least for my taste). We all loved it!

Added half an onion and a clove of garlic when I put the chicken thighs in.  Also added fresh tomato right at the end of cook time.

Excellent! This reminded me of Spanish Paella. So I added a hand full of frozen peas at the end. Since we are senior citizens I always cut back on cayenne and crushed peppers in Chef Johns recipes also we use the milder sausages and his recipes always turn out to our satisfaction.

This was a pretty easy and tasty dish - since I had bone-in thighs I browned the chicken which I think really helped. Will probably make it again and when I do I'll probably add some more veggies to give it a little more life.	this was a pretty easy and tasty dish - since i had bone-in thighs i browned the chicken which i think really helped . will probably make it again and when i do i 'll probably add some more veggies to g ive it a little more life .	1
Absolutely delicious! I couldn't help adding some chopped onions and garlic before the browning of the sausage. Also I used what ever beef sausage my Halal store carries. My orzo took 5 more minutes to cook.

My whole family loved this! I usually try to stay true to the original recipe the first time I make it but a few of the ingredients can't be found in my little town. I had Hillshire Farms Cheddarwurst on hand and substituted it for the linguica. I used one large jalapeno pepper and took the others reviewers suggestion and doubled the orzo and the flavors were amazing. Came out so good even my picky eater cleaned his plate. Smelled so good while it was cooking as well!

This is an excellent change up from the same old boring chicken! The spices really make this dish flavorful and the red bell pepper gives it color and a texture. Browning the chicken is a must because you get those great flavors left in the pan. I didn't have a bay leaf but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. If I was to make any change at all it would only be to pare back the amount of meat or increase the orzo.

This is excellent! I used bnls/sknls thighs & italian sausage as it's what I had on hand and a red & green bell pepper. Wasn't sure which paprika to use so used 1/2 hot 1/2 smoked. Didn't have orzo either used risotto. Now it seems I shouldn't even be rating this recipe since I didn't really make IT! Sorry...but the seasonings are what really made the dish and they are great. I liked having a lot of meat in it but I'm only feeding 2 - more pasta/rice is a definite budget stretcher. I will make this again and try orzo then. Thanks again Chef!

Marinated for 6 hrs. using boneless skinless thighs. Between Chef John's comment and another reviewer I figured they would work fine. Trouble is cooking time should be adjusted. Boneless cook faster than bone-in. I took the thighs out earlier than what the recipe called for (could tell they were done) but they were still a bit dry. I was also expecting more flavor 'pop' with the ingredients of the marinade. Might give it another whirl with bone-in.	marinated for 6 hrs . using boneless skinless thighs . between chef john 's comment and another reviewer i figured they would work fine . trouble is cooking time should be adjusted . boneless cook faster t han bone-in . i took the thighs out earlier than what the recipe called for -lrb- could tell they were done -rrb- but they were still a bit dry . i was also expecting more flavor ` pop ' with the ingredients of the marinade . might give it another whirl with bone-in .	1

This was different and really good on the grill. We had with rice and a salad tonight. Tomorrow I will shred the left overs for tacos. I did add a tablespoon of sugar because my juices tasted too sour for me. But I think a little more would have been fine. I will go with 2 tablespoons in the future depending on the sweetness of my juices. Otherwise I made it according to directions. A cilantro sprinkling was a great idea. I didn't go with the cabbage but will try it next time.

These are very good but I would cut back on the honey. The lemon off sets the sweetness of the honey very well. These would be easy to steam or par boil the carrots ahead of time and finish just before serving.	these are very good but i would cut back on the honey . the lemon off sets the sweetness of the honey very well . these would be easy to steam or par boil the carrots ahead of time and finish just befor e serving .	1
Very good. I sliced three regular size carrots into 1/8th inch rounds and used the recipe set to 1 serving. I also didn't have lemon juice so I used about an 1/8th of a teaspoon of lemon extract. The honey and lemon gave it a pleasant sweet taste and not at all overpowering. Will definately be cooking this again.	very good . i sliced three regular size carrots into 1/8 th inch rounds and used the recipe set to 1 serving . i also did n't have lemon juice so i used about an 1/8 th of a teaspoon of lemon extract . the honey and lemon gave it a pleasant sweet taste and not at all overpowering . will definately be cooking this again .	1

Very tasty. I followed this recipe to the letter. It’s way too soft and soggy due to, I would guess, the chicken stock. The last time I made it I found a similar recipe that lacks the balsamic vinegar, and chicken stock. Everything else was  basically the same. That recipe was much better and the leftovers were still tasty.	very tasty . i followed this recipe to the letter . it 's way too soft and soggy due to , i would guess , the chicken stock . the last time i made it i found a similar recipe that lacks the balsamic vinegar , and chicken stock . everything else was basically the same . that recipe was much better and the leftovers were still tasty .	1
Really good.  Added some fresh parmesan at the end and it worked well.  Love this because it is so easy, no special ingredients and is an amazing way to get kids to eat vegetables...our girls loved it.

Made it as written and it was very good.  But I felt that it could do with less bacon/drippings and would still be good.  The method of preparations was simple.  I think that next time, and there will be a next time,  that I would  reduce the amount of the bacon/drippings and the butter.  With all the fat that's in this recipe, it turns a very healthy side dish into one that's high in calories and fats.	made it as written and it was very good . but i felt that it could do with less bacon/drippings and would still be good . the method of preparations was simple . i think that next time , and there will be a next time , that i would reduce the amount of the bacon/drippings and the butter . with all the fat that 's in this recipe , it turns a very healthy side dish into one that 's high in calories and fats .	1

Oh My Goodness...made these this evening. Shaved them with my ceramic slicer and nothing could be easier. Used olive oil and butter then tossed in some REAL bacon bits at the end...Let them sit in the pan long enough to get a bit of brown/caramalized and they were delicious and nutty...even the teenaged boys who turned up their noses dove back for seconds.

I have been making a similar recipe for years and it has been a hit with even the non-brussel sprout lovers. I make it with a few differences.....instead of almonds I use pine nuts. this is a very nice taste saute until lightly toasted and use seasoning salt. Also at he end with the crumbled bacon add sliced green onion tops.

I agree that this recipe is a great crowd pleaser but 4 pounds of Brussels sprouts is WAY too much. I used half that amount with the same amount of the other ingredients and it worked perfectly. I served it for 8 people and we had plenty of leftovers which reheated surprisingly well.	i agree that this recipe is a great crowd pleaser but 4 pounds of brussels sprouts is way too much . i used half that amount with the same amount of the other ingredients and it worked perfectly . i ser ved it for 8 people and we had plenty of leftovers which reheated surprisingly well .	1

This was great. We used about 2 lbs or less of sprouts. My husband cut the sprouts up in 1/3's or 1/4's and it still turned out great. We realized we didn't have almonds and used pistachios and still good. I'd recommend this to brussel sprout fans.	this was great . we used about 2 lbs or less of sprouts . my husband cut the sprouts up in 1/3 's or 1/4 's and it still turned out great . we realized we did n't have almonds and used pistachios and still good . i 'd recommend this to brussel sprout fans .	1

Very good!! My husband and I loved it. I did half the recipe and it was still a HUGE amount... could have fed a family of 6 easily. Make sure you use thick slices of bacon so that you get enough fat to cook with also make sure you slice them thin. I got a little lazy near the end of my slicing and the thick pieces took longer to cook.

Sounded great but was NOT exciting. It made way too much (and we eat large portions of veg) needed to cook A LOT longer than stated and I had to add oil while cooking to help wilt it. It's possible that since I used center cut bacon that was the problem but I will not be making this recipe as written again. I too had to doctor this up to eat it and was left with a big ol' container of leftovers that nobody ate.	sounded great but was not exciting . it made way too much -lrb- and we eat large portions of veg -rrb- needed to cook a lot longer than stated and i had to add oil while cooking to help wilt it . it 's possible th at since i used center cut bacon that was the problem but i will not be making this recipe as written again . i too had to doctor this up to eat it and was left with a big ol' container of leftovers th at nobody ate .	1

I was looking for recipes to season my new cast iron skillet and I am so glad I came across this one. I wouldn't change a thing. I have another cassoulet recipe that calls for breakfast sausage so I may attempt to use that instead of the smoke sausage the next time I cook this. It smells so good while your cooking it you can't wait for it to be done. It is a little time consuming but it was cold and rainy today so it was a prefect way to stay busy indoors.

Wow. I love Chef John's recipes. I highly recommend watching his cooking videos as well. This is perfect comfort food and very easy to make. I don't have an oven safe skillet so made this in a dutch oven. I used chicken breast (thought I had thighs in the freezer but no) which was fine but I think thighs would be best. I also used breakfast sausage instead of smoked because I prefer the flavor. I also used dried rosemary and thyme (1/2 tsp. each which was plenty). I was worried that I had added to much chicken broth but if you follow all the steps by the end it thickens up so nicely (you'll see if you watch the video). I served this with a green salad with apples and dried cranberries. Thanks Chef John!

I took this to a friend's for the finishing broiler touches. Like one of the other reviewers I transfered it to a casserole dish but otherwise I didn't change a thing.

I'm sorry but this sauce basically tastes like milk and cilantro no melding of the flavors what so ever. It aches for spices and seasonings namely salt. Plus the cream never thickens up because the juices from the chicken keep it thinned out so the consistency was disappointing.

I'd never baked chicken in cream before but found it a little odd because the fat separated from the water and formed 2 layers in the baking dish.

A very good and easy soup. I used a large baking potato so the soup was nice and thick after blending. Also I didn't add the thawed broccoli until the potato was already tender and just cooked it a few minutes more so that the broccoli kept a nice green color and fresh flavor. My family including my 9-yr. old son really liked this soup.	a very good and easy soup . i used a large baking potato so the soup was nice and thick after blending . also i did n't add the thawed broccoli until the potato was already tender and just cooked it a fe w minutes more so that the broccoli kept a nice green color and fresh flavor . my family including my 9 yr . old son really liked this soup .	1
I was worried after reading other reviews of this recipe but gave it a try anyhow because it looked so easy. It turned out terrific!! It was a little bland but I just added some chopped fresh sage and a little season salt and it turned out great! And you can't beat it for healthy. For my husband I stirred a 1/4 c of chopped proscuitto (you could use ham too) into his and he loved it. I also doubled the potato as per previous reviews here and I loved the thick texture. I will definitely put this in our monthly rotation - thanks Lon!	i was worried after reading other reviews of this recipe but gave it a try anyhow because it looked so easy . it turned out terrific !! it was a little bland but i just added some chopped fresh sage and a little season salt and it turned out great ! and you ca n't beat it for healthy . for my husband i stirred a 1/4 c of chopped proscuitto -lrb- you could use ham too -rrb- into his and he loved it . i also double d the potato as per previous reviews here and i loved the thick texture . i will definitely put this in our monthly rotation - thanks lon !	1
This recipe rocks especially if you're obsessed with soup like I am! It's totally easy and totally tweakable. I used fresh broccoli two small red potatoes with the skins on and omitted the nutmeg (had none in the house). I also threw some reduced-fat white cheddar cheese in the bowl and it got all melty and delicious and tasted as good as the Panera broccoli cheddar I love but can no longer eat because it's awful for you. But even with the cheese this recipe is low-cal.

After reading some great & some not so great reviews I decided to give this soup a try even though my first impression of the ingredients did not appeal to me. Should have stuck with my first impression because I found it very bland and watery. I used fresh broccoli which may have affected it some and left out the nutmeg. After doctoring it up with some cream cheddar cheese and butter and also thickening it with some flour it was much better. This one is not a keeper for me.	after reading some great & some not so great reviews i decided to give this soup a try even though my first impression of the ingredients did not appeal to me . should have stuck with my first impressi on because i found it very bland and watery . i used fresh broccoli which may have affected it some and left out the nutmeg . after doctoring it up with some cream cheddar cheese and butter and also thi ckening it with some flour it was much better . this one is not a keeper for me .	1
AWESOME! I served this for Bunko and the ladies all loved it and asked for the recipe! The first batch I made I followed recipe exactly except for leaving out the bacon cuz we have a vegetarian in our group and made some changes for the 2nd batch which made it even better (I think!). I reduced the milk to 3 cups whole 2 cups 1% (cuz that's what we have on hand) and 1 cup chicken broth. (Because the soup is so darned thick and extremely rich!) I also sauteed 1 finely minced carrot for a minute or two then added 1 minced onion and 1 minced celery stalk til all was soft and tender then put in a minced garlic clove and sauteed for about another minute. Pureed the entire thing in my Cuisinart and stirred it into the soup along with the cheese et al. Gave it even MORE flavor--totally over the top! I then ended up stirring the two batches together and dumping the entire thing in my crock pot! I put chopped green onion bacon cheese and sour cream in little bowls for everyone to top as they wanted. Yum!	awesome ! i served this for bunko and the ladies all loved it and asked for the recipe ! the first batch i made i followed recipe exactly except for leaving out the bacon cuz we have a vegetarian in our group and made some changes for the 2 nd batch which made it even better -lrb- i think ! -rrb- . i reduced the milk to 3 cups whole 2 cups 1 % -lrb- cuz that 's what we have on hand -rrb- and 1 cup chicken broth . -lrb- because th e soup is so darned thick and extremely rich ! -rrb- i also sauteed 1 finely minced carrot for a minute or two then added 1 minced onion and 1 minced celery stalk til all was soft and tender then put in a m inced garlic clove and sauteed for about another minute . pureed the entire thing in my cuisinart and stirred it into the soup along with the cheese et al. . gave it even more flavor -- totally over the to p ! i then ended up stirring the two batches together and dumping the entire thing in my crock pot ! i put chopped green onion bacon cheese and sour cream in little bowls for everyone to top as they wan ted . yum !	1
Excellent soup. I used non-fat milk lower fat cheese and light sour cream. And I kept adding milk to it to thin it out during cooking (definitely no need for whole milk.) I added more black pepper no salt (didn't need it) and used real bacon pieces. I also cut up about half the potatoes into chunks and the rest I chopped more finely. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! It's a keeper.	excellent soup . i used non-fat milk lower fat cheese and light sour cream . and i kept adding milk to it to thin it out during cooking -lrb- definitely no need for whole milk . -rrb- i added more black pepper no salt -lrb- did n't need it -rrb- and used real bacon pieces . i also cut up about half the potatoes into chunks and the rest i chopped more finely . thanks so much for sharing this recipe ! it 's a keeper .	1
This was excellent everyone loved it. I only made minor changes - 6 spuds instead of 9 and I slightly undercooked them in the microwave and then cut them into small hunks when cooled. Then once I had the soup base thickened I threw it all in the crockpot for several hours on low until the potatoes were totally cooked.	this was excellent everyone loved it . i only made minor changes - 6 spuds instead of 9 and i slightly undercooked them in the microwave and then cut them into small hunks when cooled . then once i had the soup base thickened i threw it all in the crockpot for several hours on low until the potatoes were totally cooked .	1
Wonderful recipe for people new to making soup. It's also an easy recipe to accomodate to your tastes. I'm a vegetarian so I took out the bacon. I also substituted vidalia onions for green onions and replaced the whole milk with skim. You can try soy bacon bits but I find they become soggy. Also try adding chopped potato skins (it has all the nutrients) to the soup to make it chunkier or add milk continuously to thin it out. Even though I now need a full membership to the local gym due to this soup it's worth it. Thanks!	wonderful recipe for people new to making soup . it 's also an easy recipe to accomodate to your tastes . i 'm a vegetarian so i took out the bacon . i also substituted vidalia onions for green onions and replaced the whole milk with skim . you can try soy bacon bits but i find they become soggy . also try adding chopped potato skins -lrb- it has all the nutrients -rrb- to the soup to make it chunkier or add milk continuously to thin it out . even though i now need a full membership to the local gym due to this soup it 's worth it . thanks !	1
Thanks for posting such an easy recipe. I have made this twice and I've made the following changes.....I added a can of golden mushroom soup (plus a can of water) I substitued chives for green onions and I doubled the bacon. Delicioso! p.s. I have also made a lower-fat version using a combination of Butter and Olive Oil for the butter 1% milk for the whole milk and substituting canadian bacon for bacon. I also used 8 oz. fat free cream cheese and 2 cups of beef broth to substitute for sour cream and substituted laughing cow light cheese (3 triangles of the garlic/herb flavor) for the shredded cheddar......just as good and maybe better!!	thanks for posting such an easy recipe . i have made this twice and i 've made the following changes ... i added a can of golden mushroom soup -lrb- plus a can of water -rrb- i substitued chives for green onions and i doubled the bacon . delicioso ! p.s. i have also made a lower-fat version using a combination of butter and olive oil for the butter 1 % milk for the whole milk and substituting canadian bacon for bacon . i also used 8 oz . fat free cream cheese and 2 cups of beef broth to substitute for sour cream and substituted laughing cow light cheese -lrb- 3 triangles of the garlic/herb flavor -rrb- for the shredded cheddar ... just as good and maybe better !!	1
This soup is wonderful. I have tried many recipes but this one is JUST right. I reduced the fat a bit by using reduced fat sour cream using skim milk rather than whole milk reduced the cheddar cheese to about 6 ounces and only used 1/2 cup flour. It tasted just like restaurant potato soup.	this soup is wonderful . i have tried many recipes but this one is just right . i reduced the fat a bit by using reduced fat sour cream using skim milk rather than whole milk reduced the cheddar cheese to about 6 ounces and only used 1/2 cup flour . it tasted just like restaurant potato soup .	1

A great simple recipe.  I made it with boneless skinless chicken breasts and added a chopped onion for a bit more flavor, but I'm sure it would be just as good as directed.

Succulent and chicken breast are seldom found in the same sentence, but you can find them together here in this delightfully simple recipe, composed of a few common ingredients.   Chef John really shows off the flavor of chicken and mushrooms.  Yes, you may add more things, like wine, or aromatics, but the more additions, the more complications and subbing, and then the tweaking begins!  I chose not to view the video beforehand, just to check out the instructions and the cooking times.  I went on the low side of the recommended times, and the chicken came out perfectly, with rich, delicious mushrooms.  We really enjoyed our Sunday chicken today!	succulent and chicken breast are seldom found in the same sentence , but you can find them together here in this delightfully simple recipe , composed of a few common ingredients . chef john really sho ws off the flavor of chicken and mushrooms . yes , you may add more things , like wine , or aromatics , but the more additions , the more complications and subbing , and then the tweaking begins ! i chose n ot to view the video beforehand , just to check out the instructions and the cooking times . i went on the low side of the recommended times , and the chicken came out perfectly , with rich , delicious mu shrooms . we really enjoyed our sunday chicken today !	1
I followed this recipe to the T, and it came out delicious! It was simple, quick, and had only a few main ingredients so I didn't have to go to the store to get anything off hand. It also still tasted good when I reheated it for lunch.

Got this recipe from a top NY chef with one twist: rub skin side with your favorite pork/chicken rub ( grab one from the store-Stonewall great) then sprinkle on other side when chick is skin down. Fab favor and sauce. PS olive oil not needed as skin produces lots of rendered fat.-Drain excess when you turn chick in pan.	got this recipe from a top ny chef with one twist : rub skin side with your favorite pork/chicken rub -lrb- grab one from the store-stonewall great -rrb- then sprinkle on other side when chick is skin down . fab favor and sauce . ps olive oil not needed as skin produces lots of rendered fat.-drain excess when you turn chick in pan .	1

Excellent! I m on a special low acid diet and this fit the bill. I did not use boneless chicken breasts because I believe that the marrow in the bones add flavor. I used a cast iron skillet instead of a stainless steel skillet and it reduced the time of caramelizing the mushrooms in half. I m a seasoned cook and I always want to add something like wine or whatever to pan jus. I watched Chef John s video of this recipe and I think that I saw him sneak in some cayenne pepper in the video. Chef John always has cayenne pepper in his recipes and I d bet that he adds it to his oatmeal in the morning.:) I served this with Sarah s Rice Pilaf recipe that is posted on this site and with green beans as the 2nd side dish. It was a delicious meal.	excellent ! i m on a special low acid diet and this fit the bill . i did not use boneless chicken breasts because i believe that the marrow in the bones add flavor . i used a cast iron skillet instead of a stainless steel skillet and it reduced the time of caramelizing the mushrooms in half . i m a seasoned cook and i always want to add something like wine or whatever to pan jus . i watched chef john s video of this recipe and i think that i saw him sneak in some cayenne pepper in the video . chef john always has cayenne pepper in his recipes and i d bet that he adds it to his oatmeal in the morning . :-rrb- i served this with sarah s rice pilaf recipe that is posted on this site and with green beans as the 2 nd side dish . it was a delicious meal .	1
The challenge factor made me curious, so I had to try it. The meat was good, tender and cooked through. The accompanying sauce, however, was unrelentingly bland..  To increase the flavor, simply using chicken stock in place of water would represent a huge leap forward in sensory quality. I mean, if adding butter was acceptable, why not stock? An interesting culinary exercise, however.	the challenge factor made me curious , so i had to try it . the meat was good , tender and cooked through . the accompanying sauce , however , was unrelentingly bland . . to increase the flavor , simply using chicken stock in place of water would represent a huge leap forward in sensory quality . i mean , if adding butter was acceptable , why not stock ? an interesting culinary exercise , however .	1
This is my new favorite pasta dish and my favorite recipe on this site! The only changes I made were I used a whole pound of bacon (it was just easier) I used regular tomatoes (both yellow and red) because I didn't have any cherry ones and I ended up using green leaf lettuce because my rinky dink grocery store didn't have arugula - I could have used fresh spinach I guess. I also made Chef John's creme fraiche ahead of time (although I could have cut it in half for this recipe - you can find the recipe on this site.) The creme fraiche made this recipe so plan ahead to make this dish. I would not substitue it for anything since I've already done it this way! The creme fraiche didn't overwhelm the other flavors but gave it a subtle richness. I should have taken a picture because the yellow and red tomatoes along with the green lettuce made an attractive dish. My teenagers also loved this and I know my husband would have but he was out of town and by the time he got home the leftovers were gone. Poor guy. I didn't think it was as good left over as it was fresh though. This dish is now in my permanent rotation forever and always!	this is my new favorite pasta dish and my favorite recipe on this site ! the only changes i made were i used a whole pound of bacon -lrb- it was just easier -rrb- i used regular tomatoes -lrb- both yellow and red -rrb- be cause i did n't have any cherry ones and i ended up using green leaf lettuce because my rinky dink grocery store did n't have arugula - i could have used fresh spinach i guess . i also made chef john 's c reme fraiche ahead of time -lrb- although i could have cut it in half for this recipe - you can find the recipe on this site . -rrb- the creme fraiche made this recipe so plan ahead to make this dish . i would no t substitue it for anything since i 've already done it this way ! the creme fraiche did n't overwhelm the other flavors but gave it a subtle richness . i should have taken a picture because the yellow an d red tomatoes along with the green lettuce made an attractive dish . my teenagers also loved this and i know my husband would have but he was out of town and by the time he got home the leftovers were gone . poor guy . i did n't think it was as good left over as it was fresh though . this dish is now in my permanent rotation forever and always !	1
This is simply wonderful!! I too followed the directions exactly and found myself gobbling it up which I usually don't do with meals I've cooked. My husband also went for seconds. My store didn't have the creme fraiche so I had to make my own. Super easy recipes online! I'm also a huge fan of BLT's so that might have something to do with my love for this dish.

I made this with sour cream the first time and we really loved it. I added sun-dried tomatoes for a little more flavor. I wanted to try it with the creme fraiche so I made it again. We preferred the tang the sour cream added for sure so I'll be making it again and again but with the sour cream. I omitted the lemon as we didn't care for it in this dish.	i made this with sour cream the first time and we really loved it . i added sun-dried tomatoes for a little more flavor . i wanted to try it with the creme fraiche so i made it again . we preferred the t ang the sour cream added for sure so i 'll be making it again and again but with the sour cream . i omitted the lemon as we did n't care for it in this dish .	1

This was just ok. Arugula is not my favorite and I should have known the kids wouldn't like it but wanted to follow the recipe exactly the first time. The arugula overwhelmed the dish in my opinion and it didn't resemble a BLT at all because of that. I think perhaps with spinach or kale this would be better.	this was just ok . arugula is not my favorite and i should have known the kids would n't like it but wanted to follow the recipe exactly the first time . the arugula overwhelmed the dish in my opinion an d it did n't resemble a blt at all because of that . i think perhaps with spinach or kale this would be better .	1
Very good combination of flavors. I used (1) 1lb. box of mini penne pasta 1 lb of bacon. I doubled the rest of the ingredients other than the cream fraise which I used the entire jar I had just made.

This recipe was delicious. There is something missing from the recipe in step #5 it says to add the lime juice but nowhere in the ingredients is lime juice listed other then the limes for garnishment. I used 2 tablespoons because I found another thai recipe similiar to this one and that's what it called for. Other then that I followed this recipe to a T and it was wonderful. Although next time I would like a little more heat and will use serrano peppers instead of jalapenos. Also this is a light soup recipe and if your looking to make it more hearty try using basmati rice or glass noodle with it. They are both great. Thanks for sharing will be using this often.	this recipe was delicious . there is something missing from the recipe in step # 5 it says to add the lime juice but nowhere in the ingredients is lime juice listed other then the limes for garnishment . i used 2 tablespoons because i found another thai recipe similiar to this one and that 's what it called for . other then that i followed this recipe to a t and it was wonderful . although next time i w ould like a little more heat and will use serrano peppers instead of jalapenos . also this is a light soup recipe and if your looking to make it more hearty try using basmati rice or glass noodle with it . they are both great . thanks for sharing will be using this often .	1
Seriously delicious and very filling. Two minor changes: (i) 1 1/2 lbs. of skinless boneless chicken thighs & 1 lb. chicken tenderloins rather than all thighs and (ii) 4 tsp. red curry paste rather than 2 tsp. Chef John s video for making this soup is worth watching and apparently reflects the original way he made it versus this version seemingly altered by AR slightly.

Make it easy on yourself and use Gourmet Garden. 1/2 tube minced ginger 1/2 tube minced lemon grass 4 tsp minced garlic you will still need to strain it. I went to 3 stores before finding the red curry paste and it really didn't add much spice. I would substitute ground red pepper and use a lot of it as the coconut milk neutralizes spice. I used 3 chicken breasts and added 2 fresh tomatoes sliced at the end of the cooking. The fresh limes and fresh cilantro are an absolute must. Oh yeah the fish sauce is disgusting so just use a little salt. Serve with jasmine rice or rice noodles. This soup is every bit as good as what I have had in restaurants in Hawaii Key West and Miami. The first time I tried it I reported to my mom that I just had the most awakening soup that tasted of chicken lime and milk. Bizarre but it totally works.	make it easy on yourself and use gourmet garden . 1/2 tube minced ginger 1/2 tube minced lemon grass 4 tsp minced garlic you will still need to strain it . i went to 3 stores before finding the red curr y paste and it really did n't add much spice . i would substitute ground red pepper and use a lot of it as the coconut milk neutralizes spice . i used 3 chicken breasts and added 2 fresh tomatoes sliced at the end of the cooking . the fresh limes and fresh cilantro are an absolute must . oh yeah the fish sauce is disgusting so just use a little salt . serve with jasmine rice or rice noodles . this soup i s every bit as good as what i have had in restaurants in hawaii key west and miami . the first time i tried it i reported to my mom that i just had the most awakening soup that tasted of chicken lime a nd milk . bizarre but it totally works .	1
Just tried written directions left out a couple steps so watch the video (when to add prepared stock and how much lime juice (you squeeze two limes and stock goes in just before coconut milk)). I loved it and I only like mild spice. I agree with another reviewer the Thai Kitchen red curry paste is good but I actually had to add more and I only used 1 can of coconut milk! But this was very good with brown rice. Next time I will try the light coconut milk.	just tried written directions left out a couple steps so watch the video -lrb- when to add prepared stock and how much lime juice -lrb- you squeeze two limes and stock goes in just before coconut milk -rrb- -rrb- . i love d it and i only like mild spice . i agree with another reviewer the thai kitchen red curry paste is good but i actually had to add more and i only used 1 can of coconut milk ! but this was very good wit h brown rice . next time i will try the light coconut milk .	1
This is very close to the Authentic Tom Yum soup we made in a cooking class in Thailand. Fabulous! We added 4x the amount of red curry paste and it wasn't very hot but very flavorful.

Great simple recipe! I had a package with both broccoli and cauliflower combined so I added both to this recipe and it was delicious. I also added a bit of sweet to the vinegarette to balance the flavor a bit (agave syrup). I wanted to also comment on Chef John's video presentation. He has a wonderful down-to-earth way about him and I picked up a lot of good tips about broccoli preparation in general from this video.

This was fantastic! Cut the olive oil in half because I thought it might be too oily. It was great like that. It's a definite keeper for us. 3 of us ate it all up it was so delicious with a little bit left for hubby's lunch tomorrow. Follow Chef John's video. I just have to add to my review: we have made this several times since my last rating and I LOVE this stuff!! I follow the video exactly for cutting it and putting it in cold water to stop the cooking. I do cut the oil though because it would be way too oily if we did not. When I make it now I have to make extra we love it so much. I have never been a fan of broccoli in the past and do not really care for it raw. But I have become a fan of broccoli because of this recipe. It is simple to make and the red pepper flakes give it a nice appearance and pizzazz if making it for company.	this was fantastic ! cut the olive oil in half because i thought it might be too oily . it was great like that . it 's a definite keeper for us . 3 of us ate it all up it was so delicious with a little bit left for hubby 's lunch tomorrow . follow chef john 's video . i just have to add to my review : we have made this several times since my last rating and i love this stuff !! i follow the video exactly for cutting it and putting it in cold water to stop the cooking . i do cut the oil though because it would be way too oily if we did not . when i make it now i have to make extra we love it so much . i have never been a fan of broccoli in the past and do not really care for it raw . but i have become a fan of broccoli because of this recipe . it is simple to make and the red pepper flakes give it a nice a ppearance and pizzazz if making it for company .	1

So simple yet so good! This really perks up regular 'ol broccoli and delivers a nice amout of sweet and heat. I did cut back on the olive oil a bit but other than that didn't change a thing. This is excellent warm or cold and would be great over green beans or brussel sprouts as well. I liked the dressing so much I added a little sugar and it was perfect over a mixed green salad.

Who knew something so simple could be so good? This has such a fresh clean taste. The dressing is a bit more acidic than I like but that's just me. I added about 1/2 tsp honey to balance it out.

Just made it for my family of five last night. I just started cooking but my father ( a very good trained chef in my opinion) said it was restaurant quality. I TRIPLED the recipe and there was not one bit of leftovers. However I used sharp cheddar rather than Gruyere (a Vermonters spin on it) and instead of doing individual sandwiches I hollowed out a big loaf of artisan bread and stuffed it with the cheese sauce. We cut it into sections and had it with a side of steamed broccoli in a sharp cheddar cheese sauce. Absolutely amazing. I will definitely make this dish a regular one. It's affordable it's quick and it's delicious.	just made it for my family of five last night . i just started cooking but my father -lrb- a very good trained chef in my opinion -rrb- said it was restaurant quality . i tripled the recipe and there was not one bit of leftovers . however i used sharp cheddar rather than gruyere -lrb- a vermonters spin on it -rrb- and instead of doing individual sandwiches i hollowed out a big loaf of artisan bread and stuffed it with the cheese sauce . we cut it into sections and had it with a side of steamed broccoli in a sharp cheddar cheese sauce . absolutely amazing . i will definitely make this dish a regular one . it 's affordabl e it 's quick and it 's delicious .	1
I made this just as directed by Chef John and everyone loved them. They made the perfect lunch for us as we greeted out-of-town visitors. I did think that they were just a tad on the bland side a fact that could be that I used some Honeybaked ham rather than the smoked ham called for.

This recipe was simple and easy to make. I really liked the idea of it. I don't understand the inclusion of the pickles - they didn't add anything as far as I could tell but were just odd when you bit into them. And the texture was oddly creamy which I found to be off putting. Overall not my favorite but wasn't terrible.	this recipe was simple and easy to make . i really liked the idea of it . i do n't understand the inclusion of the pickles - they did n't add anything as far as i could tell but were just odd when you bit into them . and the texture was oddly creamy which i found to be off putting . overall not my favorite but was n't terrible .	1

For whatever reason this year I had way too many green tomatoes to fry but not enough for a big batch of relish. So time to get creative! In that mindset I tried this pie and I have to say it's good. A little odd but good. One wouldn't think it's apple but it's quite nice. I used tomatoes with a bit of a blush to them and I had to increase the baking time dramatically for the crust to brown. I would also decrease the spices next time-- the cinnamon in particular is a little too much. But it's quite a nice use for those before-the-frost tomatoes! I'll be making this again next year.	for whatever reason this year i had way too many green tomatoes to fry but not enough for a big batch of relish . so time to get creative ! in that mindset i tried this pie and i have to say it 's good . a little odd but good . one would n't think it 's apple but it 's quite nice . i used tomatoes with a bit of a blush to them and i had to increase the baking time dramatically for the crust to brown . i wou ld also decrease the spices next time -- the cinnamon in particular is a little too much . but it 's quite a nice use for those before-the-frost tomatoes ! i 'll be making this again next year .	1
I would not recommend this pie. I am like most and wanted some creative recipe for my green tomatoes and found this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and added 1 tbsp of cornstarch to prevent watery pie. The taste is extremely odd and is not like apple pie at all. I will put my green tomatoes to use in a relish or some other fashion instead of this pie. I am sad I wasted a good pie crust on it.	i would not recommend this pie . i am like most and wanted some creative recipe for my green tomatoes and found this recipe . i followed the recipe exactly and added 1 tbsp of cornstarch to prevent wate ry pie . the taste is extremely odd and is not like apple pie at all . i will put my green tomatoes to use in a relish or some other fashion instead of this pie . i am sad i wasted a good pie crust on it .	1
Very easy prep fast all around I loved this pie and was a disbeliever of anything sweet with green tomatoes. Bravo!! The sweet/cinnamon tastes like apple pie spices. Oh I would not recommend slicing the peppers into long strips as I did (too many dinners what can I say) - this was the only weird texture issue. Yes it was a bit runny am making it again tonight and will add the cornstarch per the suggestion in one of the reviews.	very easy prep fast all around i loved this pie and was a disbeliever of anything sweet with green tomatoes . bravo !! the sweet/cinnamon tastes like apple pie spices . oh i would not recommend slicing t he peppers into long strips as i did -lrb- too many dinners what can i say -rrb- - this was the only weird texture issue . yes it was a bit runny am making it again tonight and will add the cornstarch per the su ggestion in one of the reviews .	1
Wonderful! I love finding homemade seasoning blends on this site. They're so easy to scale up and keep in an air tight container for future use. Plus it's stuff I already have but would have never thought to combine and so much cheaper than buying stuff with preservatives in it.

other than the boullion granules it is an excellent rub to use on chicken to have put on and sealed in a sealer bag for a few hours or overnight before smoking. To eat that evening. Not cured but mmmm mmmmm tasty. thank you. like this rub. and adding the rosemary is a real bonus goes well with pork loin also. minus the granules. the granules are good for the backing or frying. mmmmm chili? mmmm have to try that one. sounds good.	other than the boullion granules it is an excellent rub to use on chicken to have put on and sealed in a sealer bag for a few hours or overnight before smoking . to eat that evening . not cured but mmmm mmmmm tasty . thank you . like this rub . and adding the rosemary is a real bonus goes well with pork loin also . minus the granules . the granules are good for the backing or frying . mmmmm chili ? mmmm ha ve to try that one . sounds good .	1

This spice rub has a lovely flavour but even with 1/3 the salt is way too salty on baked chicken breast! Cut the salt to 1/4 tsp and it would be perfect!	this spice rub has a lovely flavour but even with 1/3 the salt is way too salty on baked chicken breast ! cut the salt to 1/4 tsp and it would be perfect !	1
I read the reviews and I have to disagree. I know this is Chef John but this was a huge disappointment. I followed this recipe to the letter and what I ended up with tasted like meat and potatoes boiled with cabbage and water. I expected some apple flavor using the apple chicken sausage and cooking it in apple juice. The apple flavor was nonexistent and the sausage was tough (the texture really changed) burst open (not good for presentation) and I did simmer on a low temperature. It was so bland that near the end I added some caraway seeds more salt and pepper and we actually used cider vinegar at the table to add some flavor. If I were to make this again I would use more onion and add fresh apples to the cabbage. Since the sausages picked up no flavor from the apple juice and were totally cooked anyway I'd most likely not simmer them with the cabbage and just add in toward the end to reheat (they looked great after browning). Sorry Chef John this is just my opinion but I did not consider this one of your best efforts. Doubtful I'll make again too many tweaks to make this work for us.	i read the reviews and i have to disagree . i know this is chef john but this was a huge disappointment . i followed this recipe to the letter and what i ended up with tasted like meat and potatoes boil ed with cabbage and water . i expected some apple flavor using the apple chicken sausage and cooking it in apple juice . the apple flavor was nonexistent and the sausage was tough -lrb- the texture really ch anged -rrb- burst open -lrb- not good for presentation -rrb- and i did simmer on a low temperature . it was so bland that near the end i added some caraway seeds more salt and pepper and we actually used cider vinega r at the table to add some flavor . if i were to make this again i would use more onion and add fresh apples to the cabbage . since the sausages picked up no flavor from the apple juice and were totally cooked anyway i 'd most likely not simmer them with the cabbage and just add in toward the end to reheat -lrb- they looked great after browning -rrb- . sorry chef john this is just my opinion but i did not consi der this one of your best efforts . doubtful i 'll make again too many tweaks to make this work for us .	1

This was a wonderful Fall recipe! I used regular potatoes (didn't have the Yukons) peeled and cut and simmered with apple cider. It was easy to cut shreds of cabbage from the head and it tasted great much better than a similar recipe using sauerkraut. After reading other reviews it seems some have misread the recipe using apple cider vinegar instead of apple cider. Yikes no wonder they did not like the strong vinegar taste. There is no vinegar called for in this recipe. I recommend they try it again but with apple cider this time and believe they will really enjoy it!	this was a wonderful fall recipe ! i used regular potatoes -lrb- did n't have the yukons -rrb- peeled and cut and simmered with apple cider . it was easy to cut shreds of cabbage from the head and it tasted great much better than a similar recipe using sauerkraut . after reading other reviews it seems some have misread the recipe using apple cider vinegar instead of apple cider . yikes no wonder they did not lik e the strong vinegar taste . there is no vinegar called for in this recipe . i recommend they try it again but with apple cider this time and believe they will really enjoy it !	1

I'm giving it 5 stars because it's such a good base recipe and so easy to tweak. I had all of the ingredients in the house...almost. Actually used venison sausage which was quite bland so I needed more salt and lots of pepper. Only had 2 cups apple juice which is more than enough and I think vegetable or chicken broth would be just fine. Perhaps throw in a cored peeled and chunked apple or two. And it's better the next day.	i 'm giving it 5 stars because it 's such a good base recipe and so easy to tweak . i had all of the ingredients in the house ... almost . actually used venison sausage which was quite bland so i needed mor e salt and lots of pepper . only had 2 cups apple juice which is more than enough and i think vegetable or chicken broth would be just fine . perhaps throw in a cored peeled and chunked apple or two . an d it 's better the next day .	1
I did make some changes. As I didnt have enough potatoes I added some chopped apples... and when I started I thought I had apple juice in the fridge which turned out to be fruit punch (yuck). Instead of apple juice I used white wine. I think the sausage I used is the BEST tasting sausage(Aidells's). As a result of the changes It was bursting with flavors! It was incredible. Even my toddlers had a few bites. I will absolutely make it again. In fact my husband just purchased some sausage specifically for this recipe.:)	i did make some changes . as i didnt have enough potatoes i added some chopped apples ... and when i started i thought i had apple juice in the fridge which turned out to be fruit punch -lrb- yuck -rrb- . instead of apple juice i used white wine . i think the sausage i used is the best tasting sausage -lrb- aidells 's -rrb- . as a result of the changes it was bursting with flavors ! it was incredible . even my toddlers had a few bites . i will absolutely make it again . in fact my husband just purchased some sausage specifically for this recipe. :-rrb-	1

Excellent!  I followed the recipe for the most part.  I used 2 stalks chopped celery, 2 cans College Inn Chicken Broth, 1 Cup Milk, 1 Cup Heavy Cream.  I also did not puree the broccoli.  I like a chunky soup.  For the roux I melted the butter and removed from heat.  Then I measured the 3 Tbs. flour in a small bowl and added a little bit at a time of the milk/cream mixture and whisked it till smooth.  Then I added it to the melted butter.  Then added that to the soup.  NO LUMPS!  Served with Grated Cheddar Cheese and Warm French Bread.  So good on a Hurricane Wilma night.	excellent ! i followed the recipe for the most part . i used 2 stalks chopped celery , 2 cans college inn chicken broth , 1 cup milk , 1 cup heavy cream . i also did not puree the broccoli . i like a chu nky soup . for the roux i melted the butter and removed from heat . then i measured the 3 tbs . flour in a small bowl and added a little bit at a time of the milk/cream mixture and whisked it till smoo th . then i added it to the melted butter . then added that to the soup . no lumps ! served with grated cheddar cheese and warm french bread . so good on a hurricane wilma night .	1
This soup is wonderful. I made only minor adjustments to suit my tastes. I left out the celery and added fresh garlic more onion and red pepper flakes. I also added a bit of cream cheese when I was blending the soup. I used half milk and half evaporated milk and added a pinch of nutmeg at the end. This is definitely going into the recipe box.

I avoid making reviewing recipes that i have made changes to because i feel that it isn't really the recipe if i do that however that being said the only change i have ever made to this recipe is i a use a bag of frozen chopped brocoli i put the stems in before i puree and the floret bits in after I like my soup a little chunky.	i avoid making reviewing recipes that i have made changes to because i feel that it is n't really the recipe if i do that however that being said the only change i have ever made to this recipe is i a use a bag of frozen chopped brocoli i put the stems in before i puree and the floret bits in after i like my soup a little chunky .	1
I would give it 5 but I made adjustments. I added a clove of garlic to the onion/celery mix. I also added 1 shredded carrot to the broccoli. I used veg. base instead of chicken to make it vegetarian. Also I added sharp cheddar to the milk rue. Much better than using Velveeta.

Torn about reviews and what I really thought of this recipe. I really didn't care for this recipe at all. Followed it to a T and it was more of an overly gritty texture of broccoli then a creamy soup. And bland. No umph of flavor. As much salt and pepper as I had to use it still was not very flavorful as other cream of broccoli soups that I've had. So sorry it needs something.	torn about reviews and what i really thought of this recipe . i really did n't care for this recipe at all . followed it to a t and it was more of an overly gritty texture of broccoli then a creamy soup . and bland . no umph of flavor . as much salt and pepper as i had to use it still was not very flavorful as other cream of broccoli soups that i 've had . so sorry it needs something .	1
I made this soup and my husband (who is not a really big soup fan) could not get enough of it.  Only difference I made to the recipe was using 1 cup milk and 1 cup cream (since I had it on hand), rather than 2 cups 2%.  Also, I didn't have the full amount of cheddar, so I threw in maybe 1/3 cup slab of veleeta to make up the difference.  But I almost never have velveeta, and would recommend sticking with the cheddar just out of principle's sake.  I used the stock to make the flour thickener rather than the milk/cream (just a preference).  Then I added the milk and cream at the end with the cheese.  It was definitely a delicious and thick soup, just like Panera's.  Yum!

This has the potential to be a really great broccoli cheese soup.  As is, it’s just o.k.   To me it tasted like broccoli with cheese sauce.  It was bland and seemed to be lacking something.   I’m thinking it’s the cooking process.  It seems backwards.  Typically, milk products are added last because simmering can cause curdling, especially if simmered for a long period of time.  It works out o.k. for this recipe because it’s so thick from the cheese that you don’t really notice.   What I found odd was that half of the cooking time is dedicated to just simmering the milk with plain stock, absent of any vegetables or seasonings of any kind.  It’s only in the latter stage when you add the vegetables and those are only cooked just long enough until tender.   Onions, celery, and carrots are essential when it comes to adding flavor to any soup broth and it takes time to develop that flavor.  I would suggest adding those 3 ingredients to the chicken broth at the beginning so they have more cook time.  The other change I would make is when to add the milk.  I would start by adding the broth to the flour first and then the milk, but that’s just me.	this has the potential to be a really great broccoli cheese soup . as is , it 's just o.k. to me it tasted like broccoli with cheese sauce . it was bland and seemed to be lacking something . i 'm thin king it 's the cooking process . it seems backwards . typically , milk products are added last because simmering can cause curdling , especially if simmered for a long period of time . it works out o.k. for this recipe because it 's so thick from the cheese that you do n't really notice . what i found odd was that half of the cooking time is dedicated to just simmering the milk with plain stock , absen t of any vegetables or seasonings of any kind . it 's only in the latter stage when you add the vegetables and those are only cooked just long enough until tender . onions , celery , and carrots are ess ential when it comes to adding flavor to any soup broth and it takes time to develop that flavor . i would suggest adding those 3 ingredients to the chicken broth at the beginning so they have more co ok time . the other change i would make is when to add the milk . i would start by adding the broth to the flour first and then the milk , but that 's just me .	1
I hate to leave a 2-star unfavorable review. However to be fair to those who want to try this in the future I want to give my opinion: it was bland and utterly tasteless. I was so disappointed that I didn't care how close it was to Panera's recipe -- I just wanted flavor! I ended up adding a tablespoon of garlic powder and 2 tablespoons of powdered chicken broth base (2 chicken bouillon cubes would work too) and this did the trick! We ended up with a very tasty soup for dinner and I will make this regularly throughout the winter WITH my additions. Good luck!	i hate to leave a 2 star unfavorable review . however to be fair to those who want to try this in the future i want to give my opinion : it was bland and utterly tasteless . i was so disappointed that i did n't care how close it was to panera 's recipe -- i just wanted flavor ! i ended up adding a tablespoon of garlic powder and 2 tablespoons of powdered chicken broth base -lrb- 2 chicken bouillon cubes woul d work too -rrb- and this did the trick ! we ended up with a very tasty soup for dinner and i will make this regularly throughout the winter with my additions . good luck !	1

I'm rating it 3 because I have to rate it. But for a suggestion since I've made the Panera copycat before. First is to blend the ingredients, minus the cheese, in a blender. Second, the secret ingredient is a pinch of nutmeg to the final product. And btw making a roux before adding the liquids gives it more depth.	i 'm rating it 3 because i have to rate it . but for a suggestion since i 've made the panera copycat before . first is to blend the ingredients , minus the cheese , in a blender . second , the secret ingredi ent is a pinch of nutmeg to the final product . and btw making a roux before adding the liquids gives it more depth .	1
I had been craving broccoli cheddar soup and went with this one since it looked easy and had great reviews. I left out the carrots and salt by choice and added 3 chicken bouillon cubes.

I don't think I ever knew real stuffed pepper love until I met these.  Wow.  Other than using red bell peppers I didn't change a thing.  Confusion over when to add the cheese, in the mixture or as a topping, or 1/2 and 1/2.  I added it to the mixture and it was very noticeable and worked out well there.  It would've been difficult to sprinkle on top as there was a LOT of stuffing, so much I piled it as high as I could on each pepper.  Not cooking the meat first seemed stranged to me, but I think this method adds to the flavor and everything cooked to perfect doneness in the time frame given.  Spoon the sauce from the pan on afterwards for flavor and to make it look even tastier.  If you think is good the first night, it's double WOW reheated the next day.	i do n't think i ever knew real stuffed pepper love until i met these . wow . other than using red bell peppers i did n't change a thing . confusion over when to add the cheese , in the mixture or as a t opping , or 1/2 and 1/2 . i added it to the mixture and it was very noticeable and worked out well there . it would 've been difficult to sprinkle on top as there was a lot of stuffing , so much i piled it as high as i could on each pepper . not cooking the meat first seemed stranged to me , but i think this method adds to the flavor and everything cooked to perfect doneness in the time frame given . spoon the sauce from the pan on afterwards for flavor and to make it look even tastier . if you think is good the first night , it 's double wow reheated the next day .	1
I thought this recipe was great.  My family was only so-so about it but they don't care for stuffed peppers at all.  The only complaint I have about the recipe is that made as is, you have way too much filling or not enough peppers.  I used 4 very large bell peppers and still had a ton of filling left over.  I even over over stuffed mine and had extra.  I could have easily stuffed 3-4 more peppers with the filling.  I just cooked the extra filling along with the peppers in the sauce.  Thank you for a very flavorful new spin on the old stuffed pepper!	i thought this recipe was great . my family was only so-so about it but they do n't care for stuffed peppers at all . the only complaint i have about the recipe is that made as is , you have way too muc h filling or not enough peppers . i used 4 very large bell peppers and still had a ton of filling left over . i even over over stuffed mine and had extra . i could have easily stuffed 3 - 4 more peppers with the filling . i just cooked the extra filling along with the peppers in the sauce . thank you for a very flavorful new spin on the old stuffed pepper !	1
I'm not a fan of red velvet to begin with after reading reviews I thought I would give it a try& I'm not impressed. It's not vanilla and its not chocolate it really has no taste at all.

I made these for Valentine's Day and they were a big hit. Nice and moist. The only change I made was with the food coloring. Since I was using a gel food color I knew that a tablespoon would be too much so added it to the batter a little bit at a time until I got the color I wanted.

Even though this was a lot of work I give it a 5 because it was awesome. You can taste the different flavors separately and thogether they blend perfectly. I followed this recipe to a T and it came out super. I didn't have any issues with the sauce not thickening but if you're worried about it I suggest a) either not adding all of the cream at the end which I suspect wouldn't change the flavor that much or b) before adding the cream mix into it 1 or 2 TBSP flour mix it up and then pour it in and cook for a few minutes.

Really really good. It makes a ton--at least 6 GIANT servings. I followed the recipe except I used a heaping teaspoon of chicken base paste (like bouillon from Sam's) instead of broth or water. I then added sauteed mushrooms at the end (after tasting) and I really loved the addition. I don't know how thick the sauce is supposed to be but it was a bit thin easily swiped up with crusty bread. I'd bet slightly underdoing the pasta and then cooking it a while in the sauce would thicken it by soaking into the pasta. Last but not least I had to use a big pot NOT a skillet. I'm surprised no one else commented on this.

This was awesome. I made it like the recipe said but accidentally doubled the sun-dried tomatoes. I think I'll do that on purpose next time. In addition I'll probably add a few more pine nuts at the end because I like the flavor and the crunch. Like others noted it says it will feed 6 but the truth is it will feed them not only dinner but lunch as well!:) The one thing that surprised me was that I was using a super larger skillet and by the time I got to the last step there wasn't enough room. I had to dump it all in the large pot I had used to cook the pasta. So keep that in mind if you make the 6-serving recipe. The leftovers were great for lunch the next several days. I'm recommending this recipe to all the cooks I know.	this was awesome . i made it like the recipe said but accidentally doubled the sun-dried tomatoes . i think i 'll do that on purpose next time . in addition i 'll probably add a few more pine nuts at the e nd because i like the flavor and the crunch . like others noted it says it will feed 6 but the truth is it will feed them not only dinner but lunch as well ! :-rrb- the one thing that surprised me was that i was using a super larger skillet and by the time i got to the last step there was n't enough room . i had to dump it all in the large pot i had used to cook the pasta . so keep that in mind if you make the 6 serving recipe . the leftovers were great for lunch the next several days . i 'm recommending this recipe to all the cooks i know .	1
I signed up for ALL Recipies today just to rate this recipie. Made it after getting a cuisinart Food Processor for Christmas. Man it was absolutley fantastic. I sliced the chicken into small pieces and only used 4 breasts after seeing the amount of chicken I had piled up. I followed the rest to the letter.

This was great! It was fairly simple to make but came out wonderful. Worked really well with a caeser salad and crusty bread to soak up the sauce. I definately recommend.	this was great ! it was fairly simple to make but came out wonderful . worked really well with a caeser salad and crusty bread to soak up the sauce . i definately recommend .	1
Made this recipe as written with one exception. Instead of heavy cream I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2. This is a wonderful product and the recipe turned out very well with many compliments.	made this recipe as written with one exception . instead of heavy cream i used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 . this is a wonderful product and the recipe turned out very well with many compliments .	1
I would not call this phenomenal. Thankfully I only made half a batch. That said a half a batch is huge and enough for 4 people.	i would not call this phenomenal . thankfully i only made half a batch . that said a half a batch is huge and enough for 4 people .	1
This sauce came out creamier than the picture. Perhaps pulsing would retain some of the texture. It has a good taste with a little acidic tingle. Different but not off-putting. I think it works really well as a sandwich spread or vegetable dip.	this sauce came out creamier than the picture . perhaps pulsing would retain some of the texture . it has a good taste with a little acidic tingle . different but not off-putting . i think it works really well as a sandwich spread or vegetable dip .	1

Excellent! Thought I d miss the pine nuts but my husband says he prefers this recipe without them. Cruising on a sailboat we need to cook with what we have; no running down to the store for ingredients. Didn t have pine nuts onboard so made this. To save time/propane I skipped blanching the basil. Will definitely be making this again!	excellent ! thought i d miss the pine nuts but my husband says he prefers this recipe without them . cruising on a sailboat we need to cook with what we have ; no running down to the store for ingredient s. didn t have pine nuts onboard so made this . to save time/propane i skipped blanching the basil . will definitely be making this again !	1

I used a spin off of this recipe using a little lemon pepper and 1/8 cup of lemon juice. I also added chicken breast just coated in a little flour lemon pepper and lemon juice and grilled on a skillet. Chopped the chicken and added to the pasta. Really simple recipe with really great taste.	i used a spin off of this recipe using a little lemon pepper and 1/8 cup of lemon juice . i also added chicken breast just coated in a little flour lemon pepper and lemon juice and grilled on a skillet . chopped the chicken and added to the pasta . really simple recipe with really great taste .	1
I added some cream cheese and milk to make it creamier. It was still a bit dry but the family loved it so I will make it again and make some adjustments to the recipe.	i added some cream cheese and milk to make it creamier . it was still a bit dry but the family loved it so i will make it again and make some adjustments to the recipe .	1
This was the perfect sauce for a Mediterranean pizza! I loved it with roasted chicken artichoke hearts kalamata olives and feta cheese for toppings.	this was the perfect sauce for a mediterranean pizza ! i loved it with roasted chicken artichoke hearts kalamata olives and feta cheese for toppings .	1
I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed. There was WAY too much parmagan and the the consistency of the sauce was very thick. I will not be making this again.	i followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed . there was way too much parmagan and the the consistency of the sauce was very thick . i will not be making this again .	1
