This sauce goes by many names, including Sunday sauce, since that's the day it's traditionally made, but for me growing up, this was just called 'sauce.'

There aren't a lot of great uses for leftover pickle juice. I did hear recently that some people like to drink this stuff after jogging, which I found to be quite shocking, since I had no idea people still jogged.

While not identical to a pan-fried, breaded cutlet, if you want to eat tender, flavorful chicken with lots of crispy, crunchy bits, then this significantly less-messy method is for you. One of the keys to this technique is to use panko breadcrumbs, which are much larger and more jagged than regular, fine breadcrumbs. This method also allows us to introduce some additional flavor, and moisture, thanks to the 'glue' we use to attach the crumbs.	while not identical to a pan-fried , breaded cutlet , if you want to eat tender , flavorful chicken with lots of crispy , crunchy bits , then this significantly less-messy method is for you . one of the key s to this technique is to use panko breadcrumbs , which are much larger and more jagged than regular , fine breadcrumbs . this method also allows us to introduce some additional flavor , and moisture , tha nks to the ` glue ' we use to attach the crumbs .	1

I have enjoyed teriyaki many times at Japanese restaurants. If I've made it at home I've probably just bought a bottle of teriyaki sauce and brushed it on some chicken. This is an authentic version. I'm very glad I did it. The term teriyaki comes from of two Japanese words âteri' and âyaki'. Teri refers to the shine or luster of the glazed sauce, and yaki means to broil or grill the meat.	i have enjoyed teriyaki many times at japanese restaurants . if i 've made it at home i 've probably just bought a bottle of teriyaki sauce and brushed it on some chicken . this is an authentic version . i 'm very glad i did it . the term teriyaki comes from of two japanese words ` teri ' and ` yaki ' . teri refers to the shine or luster of the glazed sauce , and yaki means to broil or grill the meat .	1

When it comes to mustard, sweet-hot works amazingly well, especially as a glaze for chicken. Even though we are using skin-on bone-in chicken thighs, I'm sure it will work with any cut of chicken. By the time this is done, it doesn't have a super-strong mustard flavor. It gets mellowed out by the brown sugar and spices. The old saying 'The closer the bone, the sweeter the meat' really is true. Leaving in the bones adds a lot of flavor and juiciness.	when it comes to mustard , sweet-hot works amazingly well , especially as a glaze for chicken . even though we are using skin-on bone-in chicken thighs , i 'm sure it will work with any cut of chicken . by the time this is done , it does n't have a super-strong mustard flavor . it gets mellowed out by the brown sugar and spices . the old saying ` the closer the bone , the sweeter the meat ' really is true . lea ving in the bones adds a lot of flavor and juiciness .	1

This chicken Marsala dish was the most popular dish on the menu and the first one that I was taught.	certain dishes have a special place in my heart and this is one of them . the first real restaurant job i had in san francisco was at a small place called ryan 's cafe . it was run by a husband and wife team , michael and lenore ryan . they were true ` foodies ' before that term had even been coined . this chicken marsala dish was the most popular dish on the menu and the first one that i was taught .	1
You'll need a large, heavy-duty roasting pan (or a couple of smaller ones) and a very hot oven for this delicious dish. The long oven time makes everything beautifully caramelized and the chicken fork tender.	you 'll need a large , heavy-duty roasting pan -lrb- or a couple of smaller ones -rrb- and a very hot oven for this delicious dish . the long oven time makes everything beautifully caramelized and the chicken fork tender .	1
At some point this summer, you'll get tired of grilled chicken. No matter the marinade or the delivery system, you will simply reach your limit, and that's when you need to reach for the chorizo. Impale a few slices of this famously delicious Spanish sausage in between your chunks of chicken. As it grills it will splatter its spicy, smokey fat all over its much blander skewer-mate, and once again you and grilled chicken will be good buddies.	at some point this summer , you 'll get tired of grilled chicken . no matter the marinade or the delivery system , you will simply reach your limit , and that 's when you need to reach for the chorizo . impa le a few slices of this famously delicious spanish sausage in between your chunks of chicken . as it grills it will splatter its spicy , smokey fat all over its much blander skewer-mate , and once again you and grilled chicken will be good buddies .	1
These colors don't run, but they do stain, so I recommend eating this delicious, red, white and blueberry chicken outdoors at a barbeque. Smoky, spicy meats have been paired with sweet-and-sour, fruit-based sauces since we've had cooks, so that this combo works beautifully is no big surprise. And yes, other juicy fruit like peaches, or other berries will work nicely.	these colors do n't run , but they do stain , so i recommend eating this delicious , red , white and blueberry chicken outdoors at a barbeque . smoky , spicy meats have been paired with sweet-and-sour , fruit - based sauces since we 've had cooks , so that this combo works beautifully is no big surprise . and yes , other juicy fruit like peaches , or other berries will work nicely .	1

There aren't a lot of great uses for leftover pickle juice. I did hear recently that some people like to drink this stuff after jogging, which I found to be quite shocking, since I had no idea people still jogged. Like most brined recipes, the payoff is in the texture and moisture content and not necessarily in the taste. Having said that, these did have a nice little twang. So the next time you have nothing left in the pickle jar but the juice, you now know what to do.	there are n't a lot of great uses for leftover pickle juice . i did hear recently that some people like to drink this stuff after jogging , which i found to be quite shocking , since i had no idea people still jogged . like most brined recipes , the payoff is in the texture and moisture content and not necessarily in the taste . having said that , these did have a nice little twang . so the next time you h ave nothing left in the pickle jar but the juice , you now know what to do .	1
While not identical to a pan-fried, breaded cutlet, if you want to eat tender, flavorful chicken with lots of crispy, crunchy bits, then this significantly less-messy method is for you. One of the keys to this technique is to use panko breadcrumbs, which are much larger and more jagged than regular, fine breadcrumbs. This method also allows us to introduce some additional flavor, and moisture, thanks to the 'glue' we use to attach the crumbs.	while not identical to a pan-fried , breaded cutlet , if you want to eat tender , flavorful chicken with lots of crispy , crunchy bits , then this significantly less-messy method is for you . one of the key s to this technique is to use panko breadcrumbs , which are much larger and more jagged than regular , fine breadcrumbs . this method also allows us to introduce some additional flavor , and moisture , tha nks to the ` glue ' we use to attach the crumbs .	1

I have enjoyed teriyaki many times at Japanese restaurants. If I've made it at home I've probably just bought a bottle of teriyaki sauce and brushed it on some chicken. This is an authentic version. I'm very glad I did it. The term teriyaki comes from of two Japanese words âteri' and âyaki'. Teri refers to the shine or luster of the glazed sauce, and yaki means to broil or grill the meat.	i have enjoyed teriyaki many times at japanese restaurants . if i 've made it at home i 've probably just bought a bottle of teriyaki sauce and brushed it on some chicken . this is an authentic version . i 'm very glad i did it . the term teriyaki comes from of two japanese words ` teri ' and ` yaki ' . teri refers to the shine or luster of the glazed sauce , and yaki means to broil or grill the meat .	1
There's something extra satisfying about a recipe like this one-pot chicken and sausage orzo dish where you just basically dump the ingredients in a pot and wait until it's cooked. Sure, you have to stir it a few times, and it helps if you add stuff in the right order. But for how delicious this comes out, you're doing very little actual work.	there 's something extra satisfying about a recipe like this one-pot chicken and sausage orzo dish where you just basically dump the ingredients in a pot and wait until it 's cooked . sure , you have to s tir it a few times , and it helps if you add stuff in the right order . but for how delicious this comes out , you 're doing very little actual work .	1

When it comes to mustard, sweet-hot works amazingly well, especially as a glaze for chicken. Even though we are using skin-on bone-in chicken thighs, I'm sure it will work with any cut of chicken. By the time this is done, it doesn't have a super-strong mustard flavor. It gets mellowed out by the brown sugar and spices. The old saying 'The closer the bone, the sweeter the meat' really is true. Leaving in the bones adds a lot of flavor and juiciness.	when it comes to mustard , sweet-hot works amazingly well , especially as a glaze for chicken . even though we are using skin-on bone-in chicken thighs , i 'm sure it will work with any cut of chicken . by the time this is done , it does n't have a super-strong mustard flavor . it gets mellowed out by the brown sugar and spices . the old saying ` the closer the bone , the sweeter the meat ' really is true . lea ving in the bones adds a lot of flavor and juiciness .	1
