This tofu recipe is completely gorgeous. A former roommate introduced me to some basics with tofu, and over the past few years, I've settled on this ratio of spices and other breading ingredients. The crust on the tofu sticks is tasty and the texture is really wonderful. Serve with a relish or a dip of some sort (I love this with plain yogurt mixed with eggplant brinjal). I usually make this with a cumin-scented rice dish and a garlicky broccoli side.	this tofu recipe is completely gorgeous . a former roommate introduced me to some basics with tofu , and over the past few years , i 've settled on this ratio of spices and other breading ingredients . the crust on the tofu sticks is tasty and the texture is really wonderful . serve with a relish or a dip of some sort -lrb- i love this with plain yogurt mixed with eggplant brinjal -rrb- . i usually make this with a cumin-scented rice dish and a garlicky broccoli side .	1

This sauce goes by many names, including Sunday sauce, since that's the day it's traditionally made, but for me growing up, this was just called 'sauce.'

There aren't a lot of great uses for leftover pickle juice.

While not identical to a pan-fried, breaded cutlet, if you want to eat tender, flavorful chicken with lots of crispy, crunchy bits, then this significantly less-messy method is for you. One of the keys to this technique is to use panko breadcrumbs, which are much larger and more jagged than regular, fine breadcrumbs. This method also allows us to introduce some additional flavor, and moisture, thanks to the 'glue' we use to attach the crumbs.	while not identical to a pan-fried , breaded cutlet , if you want to eat tender , flavorful chicken with lots of crispy , crunchy bits , then this significantly less-messy method is for you . one of the key s to this technique is to use panko breadcrumbs , which are much larger and more jagged than regular , fine breadcrumbs . this method also allows us to introduce some additional flavor , and moisture , tha nks to the ` glue ' we use to attach the crumbs .	1

When it comes to mustard, sweet-hot works amazingly well, especially as a glaze for chicken. Even though we are using skin-on bone-in chicken thighs, I'm sure it will work with any cut of chicken. By the time this is done, it doesn't have a super-strong mustard flavor. It gets mellowed out by the brown sugar and spices. The old saying 'The closer the bone, the sweeter the meat' really is true. Leaving in the bones adds a lot of flavor and juiciness.	when it comes to mustard , sweet-hot works amazingly well , especially as a glaze for chicken . even though we are using skin-on bone-in chicken thighs , i 'm sure it will work with any cut of chicken . by the time this is done , it does n't have a super-strong mustard flavor . it gets mellowed out by the brown sugar and spices . the old saying ` the closer the bone , the sweeter the meat ' really is true . lea ving in the bones adds a lot of flavor and juiciness .	1

This sauce goes by many names, including Sunday sauce, since that's the day it's traditionally made, but for me growing up, this was just called 'sauce.'

There aren't a lot of great uses for leftover pickle juice.

While not identical to a pan-fried, breaded cutlet, if you want to eat tender, flavorful chicken with lots of crispy, crunchy bits, then this significantly less-messy method is for you.

This method also allows us to introduce some additional flavor, and moisture, thanks to the 'glue' we use to attach the crumbs.	while not identical to a pan-fried , breaded cutlet , if you want to eat tender , flavorful chicken with lots of crispy , crunchy bits , then this significantly less-messy method is for you . one of the key s to this technique is to use panko breadcrumbs , which are much larger and more jagged than regular , fine breadcrumbs . this method also allows us to introduce some additional flavor , and moisture , tha nks to the ` glue ' we use to attach the crumbs .	1

You can substitute sherry and soy sauce for the white wine to make a version with brown sauce.	while you may see this dish frequently at american chinese restaurants , it is actually a true cantonese dish . this is the americanized version that will duplicate what you 're used to eating for take-o ut . you can substitute sherry and soy sauce for the white wine to make a version with brown sauce .	1

St. Patrick's Day is right around the corner, and what better way to celebrate than with a loaf or two of Irish soda bread? If made correctly, this is one of the best quick breads (those leavened without yeast) you'll ever have. Subtly sweet, with a light, tender crumb, and not at all dry. You can use quick-cooking oats in place of rolled oats, if desired.	st. patrick 's day is right around the corner , and what better way to celebrate than with a loaf or two of irish soda bread ? if made correctly , this is one of the best quick breads -lrb- those leavened with out yeast -rrb- you 'll ever have . subtly sweet , with a light , tender crumb , and not at all dry . you can use quick-cooking oats in place of rolled oats , if desired .	1

At some point this summer, you'll get tired of grilled chicken. No matter the marinade or the delivery system, you will simply reach your limit, and that's when you need to reach for the chorizo. Impale a few slices of this famously delicious Spanish sausage in between your chunks of chicken. As it grills it will splatter its spicy, smokey fat all over its much blander skewer-mate, and once again you and grilled chicken will be good buddies.	at some point this summer , you 'll get tired of grilled chicken . no matter the marinade or the delivery system , you will simply reach your limit , and that 's when you need to reach for the chorizo . impa le a few slices of this famously delicious spanish sausage in between your chunks of chicken . as it grills it will splatter its spicy , smokey fat all over its much blander skewer-mate , and once again you and grilled chicken will be good buddies .	1

These colors don't run, but they do stain, so I recommend eating this delicious, red, white and blueberry chicken outdoors at a barbeque. Smoky, spicy meats have been paired with sweet-and-sour, fruit-based sauces since we've had cooks, so that this combo works beautifully is no big surprise. And yes, other juicy fruit like peaches, or other berries will work nicely.	these colors do n't run , but they do stain , so i recommend eating this delicious , red , white and blueberry chicken outdoors at a barbeque . smoky , spicy meats have been paired with sweet-and-sour , fruit - based sauces since we 've had cooks , so that this combo works beautifully is no big surprise . and yes , other juicy fruit like peaches , or other berries will work nicely .	1
An extremely delicious meal: the crunch of pine nuts and the tang of sun-dried tomatoes combine with chicken and pasta in a heavenly pesto cream sauce. Be sure to taste and salt before serving, because depending on what kind of chicken broth you use, the dish may require no salt at all or may be extremely under-salted.	an extremely delicious meal : the crunch of pine nuts and the tang of sun-dried tomatoes combine with chicken and pasta in a heavenly pesto cream sauce . be sure to taste and salt before serving , becaus e depending on what kind of chicken broth you use , the dish may require no salt at all or may be extremely under-salted .	1

When it comes to mustard, sweet-hot works amazingly well, especially as a glaze for chicken. Even though we are using skin-on bone-in chicken thighs, I'm sure it will work with any cut of chicken. By the time this is done, it doesn't have a super-strong mustard flavor. It gets mellowed out by the brown sugar and spices. The old saying 'The closer the bone, the sweeter the meat' really is true. Leaving in the bones adds a lot of flavor and juiciness.	when it comes to mustard , sweet-hot works amazingly well , especially as a glaze for chicken . even though we are using skin-on bone-in chicken thighs , i 'm sure it will work with any cut of chicken . by the time this is done , it does n't have a super-strong mustard flavor . it gets mellowed out by the brown sugar and spices . the old saying ` the closer the bone , the sweeter the meat ' really is true . lea ving in the bones adds a lot of flavor and juiciness .	1
