"What defines taste for this recipe? What can you substitute for what?
1. Keep red onion. Do not substitute it.
2. Keep bacon. You can use more bacon then requested, still be fine.
3. Raisins. I like Jumbo White raisins. Please do not use those little brown once. You need sweet-sour taste. So as previous reviewers said: you can use red grapes, halved; you can use craizins. Sweet-n-Sour!
4. Sunflower seeds or roasted almonds - doesn't matter. They both taste good in this salad. Add them before serving, so they retain cranchinnes.
5. And dressing.
For dressing you can substitute Real Mayo for Light or for extra Light or for Sour Cream+Mustard+LemonJuice+Salt. Really does not make any difference. You can substitute sugar for Splenda. You can use Red Wine Vinegar.
The taste should be sweet-salty and a little sour.
What important is the amount. If you use too little - it'll be too dry. If you use to much - it'll be soup. Add the dressing gradually. Remember that after a night in refrigirator it is going to absorb some fluid.

Now - if you do substitutions for Mayo, make sure this thing has salt in it, because if not and you use raisins... they will become grapes again :-), and sometime quite huge grapes.

This is a good recipe, but I don't think everyone made it right.  A few reviewers mentioned the bacon and the sunflower seeds getting soft.  The recipe states to put them in right before serving.  This leaves them nice and crunchy and gives the salad a nice balance.	this is a good recipe , but i do n't think everyone made it right . a few reviewers mentioned the bacon and the sunflower seeds getting soft . the recipe states to put them in right before serving . thi s leaves them nice and crunchy and gives the salad a nice balance .	1
You have to use red grapes instead of raisins. Cut the grapes in half and add to the salad. My mom has been serving this recipe in her tea house for years and always get tons of requests for it. Everywhere I bring it to I have to hand out the recipe. Please use fresh grapes though it makes all the difference in the world.	you have to use red grapes instead of raisins . cut the grapes in half and add to the salad . my mom has been serving this recipe in her tea house for years and always get tons of requests for it . every where i bring it to i have to hand out the recipe . please use fresh grapes though it makes all the difference in the world .	1
This is good. I have taken this recipe to many functions. Everyone loves it! For variety I eliminate the raisins and sunflower seeds and use red seedless grapes halved and toasted almond slivers.

This stuff is awesome. I didn't like raw broccoli before now but now this is my favorite vegetable dish. I made it with red seedless grapes cut in half instead of raisins (in the amount of 2X the raisins that the recipe calls for). I also used prepared bacon crumbles the kind that come in a plastic pouch intended as a salad topping; and low-fat mayonnaise. Be sure to use white wine vinegar--I think it makes a big difference. I think you could add just about any fruit or maybe some white chicken chunks for a complete meal. I'm going to try it with chicken and diced apple next time. Make this; I think you'll like it!	this stuff is awesome . i did n't like raw broccoli before now but now this is my favorite vegetable dish . i made it with red seedless grapes cut in half instead of raisins -lrb- in the amount of 2 x the rais ins that the recipe calls for -rrb- . i also used prepared bacon crumbles the kind that come in a plastic pouch intended as a salad topping ; and low-fat mayonnaise . be sure to use white wine vinegar -- i thin k it makes a big difference . i think you could add just about any fruit or maybe some white chicken chunks for a complete meal . i 'm going to try it with chicken and diced apple next time . make this ; i think you 'll like it !	1

This is a great recipe and is almost identical to one I've been making for years.  I only use 1/4 of the red onion, otherwise it is too strong for our taste; also, I use sunflower seeds and apple cider vinegar instead of almonds and white wine vinegar.  For an absolutely awesome pasta salad, add (2) 9-oz. pkgs. of cheese-filled tortellini, cooked al dente, then well-drained and cooled.  It makes a terrific picnic and potluck pasta salad and always gets rave reviews.	this is a great recipe and is almost identical to one i 've been making for years . i only use 1/4 of the red onion , otherwise it is too strong for our taste ; also , i use sunflower seeds and apple cide r vinegar instead of almonds and white wine vinegar . for an absolutely awesome pasta salad , add -lrb- 2 -rrb- 9 oz . pkgs . of cheese-filled tortellini , cooked al dente , then well-drained and cooled . it makes a terrific picnic and potluck pasta salad and always gets rave reviews .	1
This is an awesome salad. I do tweek it a bit. I use golden raisins or red grapes instead of raisin. I also use 1/4 cup sour cream with 3/4 cup mayo, to lighten the dressing a bit. It is an awesome salad that always gets raves and devoured very time I serve it. My dutch friends have never had a dish like this and always request I bring this to their BBQ parties.

Very good recipe however I did make a few modifications. I used turkey bacon dried cranberries and sunflower seeds in place of the bacon raisins & almonds. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and used Balsamic vinegar. My husband who won't touch a raisin and thought he didn't like dried cranberries asked for seconds!! Next time I will try it with reduced fat mayonaise.	very good recipe however i did make a few modifications . i used turkey bacon dried cranberries and sunflower seeds in place of the bacon raisins & almonds . i reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and used bals amic vinegar . my husband who wo n't touch a raisin and thought he did n't like dried cranberries asked for seconds !! next time i will try it with reduced fat mayonaise .	1
Very versatile and portable used diet mayo the raisins really add to it but soften by running under hot water in a sieve to plump them up. Healthy and Yummy!! Got too happy with the bulk food section and bought too many almonds and raisons and sprinkled them on top looked REALLY good!	very versatile and portable used diet mayo the raisins really add to it but soften by running under hot water in a sieve to plump them up . healthy and yummy !! got too happy with the bulk food section and bought too many almonds and raisons and sprinkled them on top looked really good !	1
FABULOUS!!!!!! Next time I will reduce the amount of the sugar or use Splenda. I thought it was a tad sweet but oh so good. I cannot wait to make this again for friends and can see this becoming a mainstay at BBQ's and potlucks. Looks so pretty too. I have to admit I just had some for breakfast and even the leftovers were great. Also used real bacon bits instead of frying some up and ready cut up fresh broccoli from Sams Club. Saved a lot of prep time.	fabulous !!!!!! next time i will reduce the amount of the sugar or use splenda . i thought it was a tad sweet but oh so good . i can not wait to make this again for friends and can see this becoming a mai nstay at bbq 's and potlucks . looks so pretty too . i have to admit i just had some for breakfast and even the leftovers were great . also used real bacon bits instead of frying some up and ready cut up fresh broccoli from sams club . saved a lot of prep time .	1

Easy and delicious - plus it's a great way to use up leftover grilled chicken! I didn't have pecans so I subbed toasted walnuts instead. I used a Granny Smith Apple and red seedless grapes vs. green. I also used dried cranberries vs. raisins. I mixed the dressing in a separate bowl before folding it into the chicken and other ingredients. For the dressing I used 1/2 cup of Hellman's light mayo cut with 1/4 cup of reduced fat sour cream along with the curry and a bit of salt and pepper. It chilled for just a couple of hours and it came out really good. Overall a great combination of flavors! Especially good on whole grain bread!	easy and delicious - plus it 's a great way to use up leftover grilled chicken ! i did n't have pecans so i subbed toasted walnuts instead . i used a granny smith apple and red seedless grapes vs. green . i also used dried cranberries vs. raisins . i mixed the dressing in a separate bowl before folding it into the chicken and other ingredients . for the dressing i used 1/2 cup of hellman 's light mayo cut with 1/4 cup of reduced fat sour cream along with the curry and a bit of salt and pepper . it chilled for just a couple of hours and it came out really good . overall a great combination of flavors ! es pecially good on whole grain bread !	1
LOVE this recipe my favorite of all recipes I have tried at this site. It is healthy relatively simple to make can be made ahead of time (although Hubby keeps eating it up). I often substitute depending on what I have on hand without any problems: canned chicken leftover rotisserie chicken leftover turkey fuji apples walnuts cranberries yellow onions. This is one of the few recipes my husband and my own mother has complimented me on more than once.	love this recipe my favorite of all recipes i have tried at this site . it is healthy relatively simple to make can be made ahead of time -lrb- although hubby keeps eating it up -rrb- . i often substitute dependi ng on what i have on hand without any problems : canned chicken leftover rotisserie chicken leftover turkey fuji apples walnuts cranberries yellow onions . this is one of the few recipes my husband and my own mother has complimented me on more than once .	1

Using ideas from previous reviewers, I added several dashes of poultry seasoning and garlic powder to the mayo mixture.  Instead of 1 1/2 cups dried cranberries, I used 1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1/2 cup dried cherries, and about 1 cup of halved seedless green grapes.  Omitted the green bell pepper since I don't care for it.  Outstanding!! Huge hit at the covered-dish party I brought it to.  Hubby loved it also!!  I don't believe it serves 12 as listed, unless you make small sandwiches.  I served it on lettuce leaves and it perhaps served 6 to 8.	using ideas from previous reviewers , i added several dashes of poultry seasoning and garlic powder to the mayo mixture . instead of 1 1/2 cups dried cranberries , i used 1/2 cup dried cranberries , 1/2 cup dried cherries , and about 1 cup of halved seedless green grapes . omitted the green bell pepper since i do n't care for it . outstanding !! huge hit at the covered-dish party i brought it to . hubby loved it also !! i do n't believe it serves 12 as listed , unless you make small sandwiches . i served it on lettuce leaves and it perhaps served 6 to 8 .	1
This is a wonderful chicken salad recipe. I was looking for something close to Arby's chicken salad and this was it. I omitted the green pepper and added chopped apples and sliced grapes. I highly recommend giving this recipe a shot.

Really good! Love the craisins & blend of flavors. Used mayo/miracle whip combo. Used red bell pepper because I had one. Used leftover rotisserie chicken (shredded). Toasted pecans. This is a great recipe. Don't leave anything out--everything adds to the overall flavor! Be brave! I was & I was not disappointed. Neither was my family.

This was o.k. I followed the recipe exactly and had it the same day as well as the next day. It was better the day after...but a bit dry IMO. There are so many dry ingredients and such little dressing that you can barely coat it all. Way too much crunch. There were more crunchies (bell pepper onion celery pecans) than there was chicken...and the chicken unfortunately took a backseat to the other ingredients. I have no paprika complaints but not sure what it did for the recipe. Maybe you could substitute onion powder for the green onions? And I'm going to skip the pecans maybe go with slivered almonds next chicken salad recipe I try; also nix the bell pepper.	this was o.k. i followed the recipe exactly and had it the same day as well as the next day . it was better the day after ... but a bit dry imo . there are so many dry ingredients and such little dressing that you can barely coat it all . way too much crunch . there were more crunchies -lrb- bell pepper onion celery pecans -rrb- than there was chicken ... and the chicken unfortunately took a backseat to the other i ngredients . i have no paprika complaints but not sure what it did for the recipe . maybe you could substitute onion powder for the green onions ? and i 'm going to skip the pecans maybe go with slivered almonds next chicken salad recipe i try ; also nix the bell pepper .	1
This is a wonderful salad and very forgiving as you can add almost any fruit to it and it still comes out superb! Try adding mandarin oranges - you won't be disappointed.....

The thing that makes this salad awesome is the curried cashews...wow!!!! I added some goat cheese and craisins as well. A keeper!!! Edit: After making this salad a bunch of times I found that the dressing is best when cutting back to 1/4 cup olive oil (otherwise too oily tasting) and adding 1/2 tsp of paprika. I also like to add fresh raspberries to the salad.

This is an absolutely amazing salad! The blend of flavors is very creative and super delicious. My husband and I ate it all in one sitting! I didn't have fresh rosemary and used dry instead. There was a lot of dressing left over. The next time I make this I'll only make half the dressing. I'll also try adding some goat cheese.	this is an absolutely amazing salad ! the blend of flavors is very creative and super delicious . my husband and i ate it all in one sitting ! i did n't have fresh rosemary and used dry instead . there was a lot of dressing left over . the next time i make this i 'll only make half the dressing . i 'll also try adding some goat cheese .	1
This salad is awesome!! I had it at my Mom's house and everyone loved it. This recipes is missing a few ingrediants compared to our recipe. For the dressing we put in 3 tbls toasted sesame seeds and 1 teasp. minced garlic. It also suggests you use peanut oil if you have it in place of the olive or veg. oil. With these extra ingrediants I give this recipe a 5 or in my rating system a 10. Second note: Try including Arugula (rocket) in your salad mix. It has a great nutty flavor when it is picked young and will really compliment the flavors in the rest of the salad.	this salad is awesome !! i had it at my mom 's house and everyone loved it . this recipes is missing a few ingrediants compared to our recipe . for the dressing we put in 3 tbls toasted sesame seeds and 1 teasp . minced garlic . it also suggests you use peanut oil if you have it in place of the olive or veg . oil . with these extra ingrediants i give this recipe a 5 or in my rating system a 10 . second not e : try including arugula -lrb- rocket -rrb- in your salad mix . it has a great nutty flavor when it is picked young and will really compliment the flavors in the rest of the salad .	1
This was a delicious salad! My husband and I both enjoyed it! We made a few changes.

Concept is good; execution -- not so much. Came out way too sweet for my taste; I like a salad that tastes like vegetables not dessert. Halve the honey and oil and eschew the brown sugar entirely. Another reviewer's suggestion to add goat cheese was right on. It lends a nice tang to the dish.	concept is good ; execution -- not so much . came out way too sweet for my taste ; i like a salad that tastes like vegetables not dessert . halve the honey and oil and eschew the brown sugar entirely . ano ther reviewer 's suggestion to add goat cheese was right on . it lends a nice tang to the dish .	1
This was delicious when fresh. Very flavorful. Good as leftovers the second day however bacon tends to get a little soggy. Second time I made used roasted pine nuts and sprinkled the bacon and nuts on each serving so bacon was not soggy as a leftover.

I used 4 tablespoons of Bac-o s instead of the actual bacon because I am a vegetarian but it's also healthier and makes the prep time shorter. But if going to use baco s instead of real bacon only add it right before serving because otherwise they get mushy and don't taste good. I also used light mayonnaise and added some raisins.

This recipe was recommended to me by a co-worker who makes it every year for Christmas. I also made it for Christmas dinner. Wow! It is awesome. I got many compliments. I do agree with others who state that it is time consuming but it is well worth it. I used 2 1/2 heads of broccoli and doubled everything but the sugar bacon and nuts to lower the calories. There is no need to use so much sugar as the grapes give the salad the sweetness needed. This recipe will definitely join my favourites.	this recipe was recommended to me by a co-worker who makes it every year for christmas . i also made it for christmas dinner . wow ! it is awesome . i got many compliments . i do agree with others who stat e that it is time consuming but it is well worth it . i used 2 1/2 heads of broccoli and doubled everything but the sugar bacon and nuts to lower the calories . there is no need to use so much sugar as the grapes give the salad the sweetness needed . this recipe will definitely join my favourites .	1

This was a very tasty salad that as suggested turned into a meal in itself!! I ate it for supper last night breakfast and lunch today - yummy! There is just the right blend of crunchy with tangy and the tastes were very complementary. I used maple bacon and green grapes and it was delicious. My husband generally isn't a big broccoli fan and really really like this one too.

This is one of our favorite summer meals. I use my own fajita seasoning organic black beans and my own homemade salsa. This is also good with avocado. I like to mix the salsa with a tablespoon of sour cream with the salsa to make it stretch a little more and to make it creamy. This is a great way to stretch the little meat you do have on skinny week's before payday. To make it a little more filling you can also add in cooked mexican rice. This makes a great filling for wraps too.	this is one of our favorite summer meals . i use my own fajita seasoning organic black beans and my own homemade salsa . this is also good with avocado . i like to mix the salsa with a tablespoon of sour cream with the salsa to make it stretch a little more and to make it creamy . this is a great way to stretch the little meat you do have on skinny week 's before payday . to make it a little more fillin g you can also add in cooked mexican rice . this makes a great filling for wraps too .	1
Great for a quick and easy meal! I grilled my chicken vs. pan frying and used a homemade fajita seasoning. I used regular corn and left it cold as well as the beans. I also didn't bother adding any additional fajita seasoning. I added some Mexican blend cheese and some thin sliced avocado. I topped it off with a dollup of sour cream and some thin sliced green onion. This was great served with Ranch dressing and tortilla wedges on the side.	great for a quick and easy meal ! i grilled my chicken vs. pan frying and used a homemade fajita seasoning . i used regular corn and left it cold as well as the beans . i also did n't bother adding any ad ditional fajita seasoning . i added some mexican blend cheese and some thin sliced avocado . i topped it off with a dollup of sour cream and some thin sliced green onion . this was great served with ranc h dressing and tortilla wedges on the side .	1

Yummy recipe!

WOW! What a salad. I have made this so many times and the bowl is always empty!! I have also used the dressing on other in other salads. The dressing is great on plain lettuce. I usually use bacon that is precooked from the store and have also added feta cheese almonds and dried cranberries to this salad. I do not use a blender to make the dressing just a jar and a good shake!	wow ! what a salad . i have made this so many times and the bowl is always empty !! i have also used the dressing on other in other salads . the dressing is great on plain lettuce . i usually use bacon tha t is precooked from the store and have also added feta cheese almonds and dried cranberries to this salad . i do not use a blender to make the dressing just a jar and a good shake !	1
Absolutely OUTSTANDING. I too made some changes but loved it and my wife drooled over it. I used Balsamic Vinegar and didn't have Celery seed so used sesame instead. Will most defiately be making again. Would rate this as a 10 if it were available.	absolutely outstanding . i too made some changes but loved it and my wife drooled over it . i used balsamic vinegar and did n't have celery seed so used sesame instead . will most defiately be making agai n. would rate this as a 10 if it were available .	1
My gang loves spinach and salad so this was great for us. Other than using baby spinach leaves I didn't change a thing. This recipe is also good with the hot bacon dressing which is on this site.

Oh yeah this ones a keeper. Do make extra dressing for other salads.

My boyfriend doesnt like spinach and he doesnt like salad...so when he ate two plates of this I was shocked!! I wanted a light salad for Valentine's Day so i just put water chestnuts and walnuts on top of spinach with this dressing. He said it was the best dressing ever and he was only eating salad cuz the dressing was sooo good. A note I tried using less dishes and not lugging out the food processor...doesn't work!! You MUST put it in the food processor or else it looks realy disgusting and lumpy.

You know, I always dislike those reviews that say: I changed this, I changed that, etc. HOWEVER, I am going to post one like that because I didn't have all of the ingredients necessary for the dish. Very, very good, even with my changes and omissions. I'm sure it'd be even better. We don't like peppers and onions so I skipped those. I sprinkled a little onion powder in the mix. I was all out of Balsamic Vinegar so I used Red Wine Vinegar instead. I had no fresh herbs so I skipped those too. I'm sure if I had all the ingredients it would have been even better. It was excellent.	you know , i always dislike those reviews that say : i changed this , i changed that , etc. . however , i am going to post one like that because i did n't have all of the ingredients necessary for the dish . v ery , very good , even with my changes and omissions . i 'm sure it 'd be even better . we do n't like peppers and onions so i skipped those . i sprinkled a little onion powder in the mix . i was all out of ba lsamic vinegar so i used red wine vinegar instead . i had no fresh herbs so i skipped those too . i 'm sure if i had all the ingredients it would have been even better . it was excellent .	1
I thought this was a great salad! I used a red pepper instead of a green I added diced cucumber and I only used half of the lemon juice.

I hardly ever leave reviews but this was sooo good I had to rate it!

I really like this recipe i'm a vegetarian so I did a few substitutes (I use vegetable broth and no chicken. I also don't like olives so I didn't use any..) The recipe was still great and it's an awesome protein dish that I can throw together really quickly using whatever vegetables I have on hand. I have made a habit of making this dish in large quantities then refrigerating it so I can take it to work later in the week. It's the kinda dish that tastes as good or better on the second day.

Excellent! I adjusted the recipe: cooked quinoa in chicken broth rather than water and bouillon; eliminated the garlic and parsley; used a yellow onion rather than red and yellow bell pepper rather than green; added green onions sun-dried tomatoes grated carrot a couple handfuls of chiffonade spinach leaves and sliced celery.

O....M....G!!!!! DINNER LAST NIGHT WAS AMAZING! My husband and I LOVED this. He's not big on trying new things but when I told him about how healthy quinoa is and had a way to make it that he'd like he went for it. I read over the reviews to see what adjustments we could make and with them it was delicious! We omitted the salt used half the lemon juice and added chickpeas. I cooked the quinoa in vegetable broth and used red instead of green pepper (that's all I had). I also am weird about raw onions so when the chicken was almost done I threw in the onions so they could cook a little. We will definitely make this over and over again! Thanks a ton!!!

This was good but I thought the lemon flavor overpowered the other flavors in the salad. That being said I will make this again because it's a good and healthy option for lunch.	this was good but i thought the lemon flavor overpowered the other flavors in the salad . that being said i will make this again because it 's a good and healthy option for lunch .	1
This is my new favorite pasta dish and my favorite recipe on this site! The only changes I made were I used a whole pound of bacon (it was just easier) I used regular tomatoes (both yellow and red) because I didn't have any cherry ones and I ended up using green leaf lettuce because my rinky dink grocery store didn't have arugula - I could have used fresh spinach I guess. I also made Chef John's creme fraiche ahead of time (although I could have cut it in half for this recipe - you can find the recipe on this site.) The creme fraiche made this recipe so plan ahead to make this dish. I would not substitue it for anything since I've already done it this way! The creme fraiche didn't overwhelm the other flavors but gave it a subtle richness. I should have taken a picture because the yellow and red tomatoes along with the green lettuce made an attractive dish. My teenagers also loved this and I know my husband would have but he was out of town and by the time he got home the leftovers were gone. Poor guy. I didn't think it was as good left over as it was fresh though. This dish is now in my permanent rotation forever and always!	this is my new favorite pasta dish and my favorite recipe on this site ! the only changes i made were i used a whole pound of bacon -lrb- it was just easier -rrb- i used regular tomatoes -lrb- both yellow and red -rrb- be cause i did n't have any cherry ones and i ended up using green leaf lettuce because my rinky dink grocery store did n't have arugula - i could have used fresh spinach i guess . i also made chef john 's c reme fraiche ahead of time -lrb- although i could have cut it in half for this recipe - you can find the recipe on this site . -rrb- the creme fraiche made this recipe so plan ahead to make this dish . i would no t substitue it for anything since i 've already done it this way ! the creme fraiche did n't overwhelm the other flavors but gave it a subtle richness . i should have taken a picture because the yellow an d red tomatoes along with the green lettuce made an attractive dish . my teenagers also loved this and i know my husband would have but he was out of town and by the time he got home the leftovers were gone . poor guy . i did n't think it was as good left over as it was fresh though . this dish is now in my permanent rotation forever and always !	1
This is simply wonderful!! I too followed the directions exactly and found myself gobbling it up which I usually don't do with meals I've cooked. My husband also went for seconds. My store didn't have the creme fraiche so I had to make my own. Super easy recipes online! I'm also a huge fan of BLT's so that might have something to do with my love for this dish.

I made this with sour cream the first time and we really loved it. I added sun-dried tomatoes for a little more flavor. I wanted to try it with the creme fraiche so I made it again. We preferred the tang the sour cream added for sure so I'll be making it again and again but with the sour cream.

This was just ok. Arugula is not my favorite and I should have known the kids wouldn't like it but wanted to follow the recipe exactly the first time. The arugula overwhelmed the dish in my opinion and it didn't resemble a BLT at all because of that. I think perhaps with spinach or kale this would be better.	this was just ok . arugula is not my favorite and i should have known the kids would n't like it but wanted to follow the recipe exactly the first time . the arugula overwhelmed the dish in my opinion an d it did n't resemble a blt at all because of that . i think perhaps with spinach or kale this would be better .	1

Every so often I like to play around with egg salad to do something a little different from the traditional mayonnaise/celery thing.  This was sensationally delicious!  I used full fat sour cream and mayo, green onion other than the red, and real, crumbled bacon, but otherwise stuck to the recipe as written. And I will next time too! Looking over the reviews, if you omit bacon, omit onion, omit the mustard, etc.--are you really trying or reviewing THIS recipe?  I like the addition of sour cream (I do in all my mayonnaise-based salads as well) as it mellows out the tang of the mayonnaise. I've used Dijon mustard before and love it, but it was the bacon and horseradish that really were this recipe's claim to distinction!

I make this all the time. I have put the bacon in before but prefer it without. I scale up or down the horseradish depending on who I'm serving it to. I also love to add a bit of celery and some sliced green olives with pimentos. Excellent on toasted sourdough. Always a hit. I love to see people trying to figure out what's in it.

Wow! Was this ever good! I scaled it way back because it was just lunch for me so I may not have gotten the proportions exactly right but they were close. I used a piece of real bacon and onion powder since I didn't have red onion. Ate it in a pita and finished wishing I had more.

This is without a doubt the best egg salad recipe I've had. I wanted to try something different and this truly fit the bill. Don't let anything out especially the bacon. I didn't measure my ingredients and it turned out great. I put a little too much mustard in but that was my fault. I didn't think that I had Dijon mustard so I put spicy brown in and then found the Dijon so added more. It was still as the title says awesome egg salad!	this is without a doubt the best egg salad recipe i 've had . i wanted to try something different and this truly fit the bill . do n't let anything out especially the bacon . i did n't measure my ingredient s and it turned out great . i put a little too much mustard in but that was my fault . i did n't think that i had dijon mustard so i put spicy brown in and then found the dijon so added more . it was stil l as the title says awesome egg salad !	1
AWESOME! I used 8 eggs (all I had) so I scaled to 1/4 cup 1 TBS Mayo and 1/4 cup 1 TBS Sour Cream. I used 2 tsp dry mustard powder because I didn't have any Dijon (I'll use Dijon next time). I used yellow onion because that's what I had. I omitted the bacon (personal preference). Added 1 tsp dried dill weed. I too thought that 1 teaspoon (rather than 1 TBS) prepared horseradish was sufficient for my taste but hey I am a coward.	awesome ! i used 8 eggs -lrb- all i had -rrb- so i scaled to 1/4 cup 1 tbs mayo and 1/4 cup 1 tbs sour cream . i used 2 tsp dry mustard powder because i did n't have any dijon -lrb- i 'll use dijon next time -rrb- . i used ye llow onion because that 's what i had . i omitted the bacon -lrb- personal preference -rrb- . added 1 tsp dried dill weed . i too thought that 1 teaspoon -lrb- rather than 1 tbs -rrb- prepared horseradish was sufficient for my taste but hey i am a coward .	1

I really liked this recipe. The only thing I might change is omitting the bacon don't quite understand why you would want bacon but I would also up the horseradish. Mine also turned out very runny not sure if that is from the sour cream but I might either use regular sour cream instead of light or omit it all together. Other than that the whole family enjoyed it.	i really liked this recipe . the only thing i might change is omitting the bacon do n't quite understand why you would want bacon but i would also up the horseradish . mine also turned out very runny not sure if that is from the sour cream but i might either use regular sour cream instead of light or omit it all together . other than that the whole family enjoyed it .	1

I tried this recipe and it came out pretty good. The only thing I will definitely add next time is more cheese. I also added some milk to the recipe to give it a fluffier consistency. Other than that will try again. What I like most about this recipe is that it can be tweaked to my specifications add bell pepper or mushroom use bacon instead of sausage.

After reading other reviews I changed this up a little myself. I used bacon instead of sausage (my husband likes bacon a lot more).. I added some shredded cheddar cheese (about 1/2 c) hot sauce (2 tbsp) and instead of eggs I used the southwestern egg beaters (3 c = 12 eggs).. I had a little left over after I filled the muffin tins but I just scrambled them up and fed them to my husband.

I made a half recipe of this (a little over a quarter of a pound) and used ground turkey that I spiced up to taste like ground pork breakfast sausage (sage paprika little red pepper flake brown sugar coriander garlic powder onion powder). I ended up leaving out the onion only because I figured that I had added onion powder and didn't want to cut up an onion just to use a little anyhow. I've made scrambled egg muffins before so I knew to grease the heckfire out of my tins before adding the egg mixture. To make it easier I evenly portioned the cooked turkey meat into the six muffin tins then poured the egg mix over each individual portion. This was really easy and well loved by all of us. Next time I might add chopped ham and shredded cheese or do all chopped vegetables.

this is (basically) a salad I've made for years everyone loves it! haven't used bacon but why not! I use toasted pecans because I like them. 4 servings. 1/4 C walnut pieces toasted 1 medium head Romaine torn 1/2 bunch watercress 1 large Granny Smith apple cored & sliced thinly & brushed lightly with lemon juice to prevent discolouration 4 ozs. Stilton crumbled. Dressing: whisk 6 TBLspns. olive oil 3 TBLspns. raspberry or Balsamic vinegar salt & pepper to taste in small bowl. when ready to serve toss greens with dressing arrange on plate. arrange apple slices around the edges (pointy ends to centre) sprinkle with cheese top centre with nuts.

The bacon was the saving grace but I will not make this again. The balsamic vinaigrette was over powering taking away from the flavors. I threw a lot of this away. In addition it is ugly.	the bacon was the saving grace but i will not make this again . the balsamic vinaigrette was over powering taking away from the flavors . i threw a lot of this away . in addition it is ugly .	1
I was nervous to experiment with a new dish for our party... especially because there had only been 2 reviews... but it was SO good!! Everyone loved them! The pear had such a delicate flavor you could hardly tell it was there I used d'anjou pears I don't know if another kind would taste different. Don't skimp on the cheese... I cooked up 4 sweet onions (3 inches in diameter) and had about a cup left over. Three onions would have done just fine.	i was nervous to experiment with a new dish for our party ... especially because there had only been 2 reviews ... but it was so good !! everyone loved them ! the pear had such a delicate flavor you could hardly tell it was there i used d'anjou pears i do n't know if another kind would taste different . do n't skimp on the cheese ... i cooked up 4 sweet onions -lrb- 3 inches in diameter -rrb- and had about a cup le ft over . three onions would have done just fine .	1
I really liked these but the whole process was a little strange. The flavor was good and the guests ate them up but the next time I make them I will use the puff pastry cups. I tried it both as written in the directions and as one reviewer mentioned stuffing the triangles. both ways didn't get enough filling for me and I ended up with huge bites of puff pastry with only the middle bite with filling. I would highly recommend this recipe and I will make it again just using the cups instead.	i really liked these but the whole process was a little strange . the flavor was good and the guests ate them up but the next time i make them i will use the puff pastry cups . i tried it both as writte n in the directions and as one reviewer mentioned stuffing the triangles . both ways did n't get enough filling for me and i ended up with huge bites of puff pastry with only the middle bite with fillin g. i would highly recommend this recipe and i will make it again just using the cups instead .	1
This recipe came out amazing! I did like the previous review and put the items inside the triangles. It was a hit with the group I made it for and I would definitely make it again! I might next time add a little balsamic vinegar for a bit more flavor though.	this recipe came out amazing ! i did like the previous review and put the items inside the triangles . it was a hit with the group i made it for and i would definitely make it again ! i might next time a dd a little balsamic vinegar for a bit more flavor though .	1

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! The pear has such a subtle flavor that the combination with onions and blue cheese make the perfect compliment.

Thanks so much to everyone for your great reviews. I've tried folded over pastry and pastry cups but I still prefer them open face. I recently treated myself to a very expensive bottle of balsamic and its great in the recipe!!

I'm not a fan of black-eyed peas but my wife is Southern and I wanted her to fulfill her New Year's requirement. This soup is incredibly delicious. I did substitute beef broth for the water / bouillon and I left out the chilies otherwise I stayed true to the recipe. The Ro-Tel tomatoes brought the perfect amount of heat for us. This soup is very meaty and the black-eyed peas play a supporting role bringing a pleasant complexity to the flavor. If you really like them I think that you could easily add another can without overwhelming the soup. I made Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread to go with it. Tomorrow's leftovers will be with rice. I can hardly wait.	i 'm not a fan of black-eyed peas but my wife is southern and i wanted her to fulfill her new year 's requirement . this soup is incredibly delicious . i did substitute beef broth for the water / bouillon and i left out the chilies otherwise i stayed true to the recipe . the ro-tel tomatoes brought the perfect amount of heat for us . this soup is very meaty and the black-eyed peas play a supporting role bringing a pleasant complexity to the flavor . if you really like them i think that you could easily add another can without overwhelming the soup . i made grandmother 's buttermilk cornbread to go with it . tomorrow 's leftovers will be with rice . i can hardly wait .	1
Excellent!!! I didn't have pork sausage so I ground some pork sirloin with my Kitchen Aid mixer and used that. Since it wasn't seasoned as sausage I added about 1/2 teaspoon sage and extra garlic salt. That's the only change I made and this stuff is wonderful! I'm serving with cornbread and can't wait until time to eat! Try this it is excellent!!! edited...Dinner is over and we enjoyed every bite! I'm almost afraid to try it with the sausage since the ground pork was so good! I will however try the sausage next time and report back.:)	excellent !!! i did n't have pork sausage so i ground some pork sirloin with my kitchen aid mixer and used that . since it was n't seasoned as sausage i added about 1/2 teaspoon sage and extra garlic salt . that 's the only change i made and this stuff is wonderful ! i 'm serving with cornbread and ca n't wait until time to eat ! try this it is excellent !!! edited ... dinner is over and we enjoyed every bite ! i 'm almost afraid to try it with the sausage since the ground pork was so good ! i will however try the sausage next time and report back. :-rrb-	1

Absolutely delish!! This is a quick and easy meal that tastes fantastic! My husband and the kids loved it. We served it with salad and corn chips. The only change I made was adding pinto beans and navy beans instead of the black-eyed peas. It is all I had on hand. Black-eyed peas are beans anyway so I can't imagine the taste would be that much different if I had used the black-eyed peas. This recipe is absolutely worth making. It is so easy and uses ingredients that many people would have on hand.

This was delicious! It was a last minute meal and I happened to have 3 cans of black eyed peas! The only change I made was adding 2 cans of Rotel and not the extra can of green chilies. The whole family liked it - 11 and up.	this was delicious ! it was a last minute meal and i happened to have 3 cans of black eyed peas ! the only change i made was adding 2 cans of rotel and not the extra can of green chilies . the whole fami ly liked it - 11 and up .	1

I didn't care for this soup at all but the men of the house loved it. I just durn like the flavored of beef and sausage mixed together. I'd do it again differently if the guys want me to but otherwise I wouldn't make a new attempt.	i did n't care for this soup at all but the men of the house loved it . i just durn like the flavored of beef and sausage mixed together . i 'd do it again differently if the guys want me to but otherwise i would n't make a new attempt .	1
This recipe is a good twist if you are not in the mood for the same old 3 bean salad.

Very versatile dish- I substitued cannellini beans because I did not have butter beans on hand and I also used marinated artichoke hearts instead. If you don't have the marinated artichokes on hand you could just add a small clove of garlic crushed to the dressing for added flavor. You could really play with the ingredients on this one to suit your tastes!

This is an excellent quick choice! Made it for a picnic at my in-laws and it was a big hit. Didn't spice it up like I normally would have (little more salt-n-pepper and hotter mustard) but it turned out just perfect to serve to a variety of people. I also added mushrooms and some wax beans.

This recipe was great but we did make a few changes (mostly due to ingredients we had at home). We substituted wax beans for the butter beans omitted the mustard and also put in some garbanzo beans hominy feta cheese and roasted bell peppers.

AWESOME! I served this for Bunko and the ladies all loved it and asked for the recipe! The first batch I made I followed recipe exactly except for leaving out the bacon cuz we have a vegetarian in our group, and made some changes for the 2nd batch which made it even better (I think!). I reduced the milk to 3 cups whole, 2 cups 1% (cuz that's what we have on hand), and 1 cup chicken broth. (Because the soup is so darned thick and extremely rich!) I also sauteed 1 finely minced carrot for a minute or two, then added 1 minced onion and 1 minced celery stalk til all was soft and tender, then put in a minced garlic clove and sauteed for about another minute. Pureed the entire thing in my Cuisinart and stirred it into the soup along with the cheese, et al. Gave it even MORE flavor--totally over the top! I then ended up stirring the two batches together and dumping the entire thing in my crock pot! I put chopped green onion, bacon, cheese and sour cream in little bowls for everyone to top as they wanted.

Excellent soup. I used non-fat milk lower fat cheese and light sour cream. And I kept adding milk to it to thin it out during cooking (definitely no need for whole milk.) I added more black pepper no salt (didn't need it) and used real bacon pieces. I also cut up about half the potatoes into chunks and the rest I chopped more finely. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! It's a keeper.	excellent soup . i used non-fat milk lower fat cheese and light sour cream . and i kept adding milk to it to thin it out during cooking -lrb- definitely no need for whole milk . -rrb- i added more black pepper no salt -lrb- did n't need it -rrb- and used real bacon pieces . i also cut up about half the potatoes into chunks and the rest i chopped more finely . thanks so much for sharing this recipe ! it 's a keeper .	1
This was excellent everyone loved it. I only made minor changes - 6 spuds instead of 9 and I slightly undercooked them in the microwave and then cut them into small hunks when cooled. Then once I had the soup base thickened I threw it all in the crockpot for several hours on low until the potatoes were totally cooked.	this was excellent everyone loved it . i only made minor changes - 6 spuds instead of 9 and i slightly undercooked them in the microwave and then cut them into small hunks when cooled . then once i had the soup base thickened i threw it all in the crockpot for several hours on low until the potatoes were totally cooked .	1
Wonderful recipe for people new to making soup. It's also an easy recipe to accomodate to your tastes. I'm a vegetarian so I took out the bacon. I also substituted vidalia onions for green onions and replaced the whole milk with skim. You can try soy bacon bits but I find they become soggy. Also try adding chopped potato skins (it has all the nutrients) to the soup to make it chunkier or add milk continuously to thin it out. Even though I now need a full membership to the local gym due to this soup it's worth it.

Thanks for posting such an easy recipe. I have made this twice and I've made the following changes.....I added a can of golden mushroom soup (plus a can of water) I substitued chives for green onions and I doubled the bacon. Delicioso! p.s. I have also made a lower-fat version using a combination of Butter and Olive Oil for the butter 1% milk for the whole milk and substituting canadian bacon for bacon. I also used 8 oz. fat free cream cheese and 2 cups of beef broth to substitute for sour cream and substituted laughing cow light cheese (3 triangles of the garlic/herb flavor) for the shredded cheddar......just as good and maybe better!!	thanks for posting such an easy recipe . i have made this twice and i 've made the following changes ... i added a can of golden mushroom soup -lrb- plus a can of water -rrb- i substitued chives for green onions and i doubled the bacon . delicioso ! p.s. i have also made a lower-fat version using a combination of butter and olive oil for the butter 1 % milk for the whole milk and substituting canadian bacon for bacon . i also used 8 oz . fat free cream cheese and 2 cups of beef broth to substitute for sour cream and substituted laughing cow light cheese -lrb- 3 triangles of the garlic/herb flavor -rrb- for the shredded cheddar ... just as good and maybe better !!	1
This soup is wonderful. I have tried many recipes but this one is JUST right. I reduced the fat a bit by using reduced fat sour cream using skim milk rather than whole milk reduced the cheddar cheese to about 6 ounces and only used 1/2 cup flour. It tasted just like restaurant potato soup.	this soup is wonderful . i have tried many recipes but this one is just right . i reduced the fat a bit by using reduced fat sour cream using skim milk rather than whole milk reduced the cheddar cheese to about 6 ounces and only used 1/2 cup flour . it tasted just like restaurant potato soup .	1

I made two batches of this recipe. One I made just as written and it was delicious! The second one I made exactly as written with one substitution: I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce in place of the butter. It too was absolutely delicious and the butter (and all those extra calories) was not missed one little bit. So I give this two thumbs up whichever way you choose to make it but I will be making it with the apple sauce to keep it healthy and light but just as delicious!!

Made this last night exactly per the recipe. Read all the reviews and appreciated the hints. It is very good. Nice texture spongy consistency and good flavor. Since all my loaf recipes call for an hour of baking mine was in the oven for an hour and came out exactly like the picture - it raised to the top of the pan and didn't deflate. I chopped up the apples in my Pampered Chef chopper so my apple pieces were very small/tiny. I also folded the flour mixture into the creamed mixture with a spatula (not the electric mixture) added the milk as instructed and folded that in. As best as I can describe its doneness is when the cake part that seeps through the top is tan and has a dry look to it. I also learned that I should have left a margin of cake batter between the brown sugar mix and the cake pan otherwise if the brown sugar seeps out on the sides it turns very hard.

This was very good and everybody liked it. One thing I would do differently next time is to toss the apples and cranberries together with the sugar etc. I usually pile my apples really high because they shrink when cooking - I couldn't do that and put the cranberries on top because the cranberries would roll off. So my pie ended up very thin. Delicious but more the thickness of a tart. With that one change this would be 5 stars. I do believe this will be making an appearance at the Thanksgiving dessert table.	this was very good and everybody liked it . one thing i would do differently next time is to toss the apples and cranberries together with the sugar etc. . i usually pile my apples really high because th ey shrink when cooking - i could n't do that and put the cranberries on top because the cranberries would roll off . so my pie ended up very thin . delicious but more the thickness of a tart . with that o ne change this would be 5 stars . i do believe this will be making an appearance at the thanksgiving dessert table .	1
This pie has a refreshing tartness that is usually absent from the Thanksgiving table. It's not fussy and very versatile. Last night instead of apples I thawed some peaches that we froze last August. I also added 1/4 tsp. of cloves. Like another reviewer I mixed the fruit sugar cornstarch and spices before adding to the pie. On a scale of 1 to 5 my husband gave it a 10.	this pie has a refreshing tartness that is usually absent from the thanksgiving table . it 's not fussy and very versatile . last night instead of apples i thawed some peaches that we froze last august . i also added 1/4 tsp . of cloves . like another reviewer i mixed the fruit sugar cornstarch and spices before adding to the pie . on a scale of 1 to 5 my husband gave it a 10 .	1
My DH and I loved this pie and I don't even like apple pie! The combination of the sweet and tart was spot on for us. I did make a change in the mixing of the ingredients. I folded the apples cranberries sugar cornstarch and cinnamon together before adding it to the crust. I also zested the peel from an orange that I had in the mix. Dotted the filling and added the top crust. I had Honey Crisp and Granny Smith apples so I used a mixture of both kinds. Wonderful served with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Great recipe however my cranberries were super tart so I ended up picking around most of them while eating this. Don't know if this is normal for cranberries. I know they're relatively tart anyways but mine just seemed way too sour. Some of them unbearably so. That said... I like the other reviewers mixed the apples sugar cornstarch and cranberries together. Just makes more sense to do it that way. Next time I make this I'll be changing the amount of cranberries to only a cup or maybe even just half a cup. Overall really good and everyone that tried it liked it. A nice variation on apple pie. And for those curious I used gala apples.	great recipe however my cranberries were super tart so i ended up picking around most of them while eating this . do n't know if this is normal for cranberries . i know they 're relatively tart anyways bu t mine just seemed way too sour . some of them unbearably so . that said ... i like the other reviewers mixed the apples sugar cornstarch and cranberries together . just makes more sense to do it that way . next time i make this i 'll be changing the amount of cranberries to only a cup or maybe even just half a cup . overall really good and everyone that tried it liked it . a nice variation on apple pie . and for those curious i used gala apples .	1

As someone else suggested I tossed the berries and apples with the sugar spice and cornstarch. I also added some extra cinnamon a bit of nutmeg and a dash of clove to jazz it up. I also used only 2 medium Granny Smiths which would be about half the apples called for but the sugar was just right. I don't like my sweets as sweet as some people do and cranberries should be tart!

The cranberries were WAY too tart. They were completely inedible. I don't know if adding more sugar would help? I took the advice of one of the reviewers and mixed the apples and cranberries with the sugar mixture in a bowl first before putting it into the pie. So maybe that was where I went wrong. Maybe if you place the apples then cranberries then the sugar mixture on top the cranberries get most of the sugar? I don't know. But I probably will not make this again.	the cranberries were way too tart . they were completely inedible . i do n't know if adding more sugar would help ? i took the advice of one of the reviewers and mixed the apples and cranberries with the sugar mixture in a bowl first before putting it into the pie . so maybe that was where i went wrong . maybe if you place the apples then cranberries then the sugar mixture on top the cranberries get mos t of the sugar ? i do n't know . but i probably will not make this again .	1
This stuffing is incredible! Instead of leeks I used 4 cups of chopped onion. I also used Bob Evans Pork Sausage instead of sweet italian sausage. This was so moist and full of flavor. It made enough to stuff the turkey and fill a baking dish. It's worth the preparation and I'll definitely be making this again next year.	this stuffing is incredible ! instead of leeks i used 4 cups of chopped onion . i also used bob evans pork sausage instead of sweet italian sausage . this was so moist and full of flavor . it made enough to stuff the turkey and fill a baking dish . it 's worth the preparation and i 'll definitely be making this again next year .	1
Excellent easy and delicious. I did use the leeks - and three large leeks measured out to the 6 cups. I was worried about the large amount of leeks in the recipe but they were an excellent addition to the recipe and cooked down considerably. I did use turkey sausage as the recipe submittor suggested. I also used dried cherries instead of cranberries. About 3/4s of a 1-pound loaf of white bread produced 12 cups of bread cubes called for in the recipe which I toasted briefly in my oven as it preheated. This looked elegant on the table - very impressive. I baked it alone rather than stuffing my bird so I used just a bit extra chicken broth.	excellent easy and delicious . i did use the leeks - and three large leeks measured out to the 6 cups . i was worried about the large amount of leeks in the recipe but they were an excellent addition to the recipe and cooked down considerably . i did use turkey sausage as the recipe submittor suggested . i also used dried cherries instead of cranberries . about 3/4 s of a 1 pound loaf of white bread pro duced 12 cups of bread cubes called for in the recipe which i toasted briefly in my oven as it preheated . this looked elegant on the table - very impressive . i baked it alone rather than stuffing my b ird so i used just a bit extra chicken broth .	1
I got lots of great feedback on this stuffing. I made it to take to my daughter's Thanksgiving feast at school this week. I used 4 cups of onions instead of the leeks. It seemed like an awful lot of onion but once it was cooked it tasted great. Because the feast was at lunch time I made this the night before and heated it the next day. If anything I think it improved the flavor because it all had time to meld together. Just remember to factor in extra baking time if you do this. It really took quite a while for all that cold stuffing to heat up. However it would be nice to be able to make this the night before Thanksgiving and just heat it up on Thanksgiving leaving more time for all those other dishes that need your attention.	i got lots of great feedback on this stuffing . i made it to take to my daughter 's thanksgiving feast at school this week . i used 4 cups of onions instead of the leeks . it seemed like an awful lot of o nion but once it was cooked it tasted great . because the feast was at lunch time i made this the night before and heated it the next day . if anything i think it improved the flavor because it all had time to meld together . just remember to factor in extra baking time if you do this . it really took quite a while for all that cold stuffing to heat up . however it would be nice to be able to make this the night before thanksgiving and just heat it up on thanksgiving leaving more time for all those other dishes that need your attention .	1
We have served this several years in a row and LOVE it. I do alter it a smidge by adding a little more chicken broth at the end (which I believe the directions forgot to tell you to add in the first place but it is in the ingredient list.) Instead of 1 1/3 cups I add 2 cups. This year I made it with sourdough bread and it turned out divine.	we have served this several years in a row and love it . i do alter it a smidge by adding a little more chicken broth at the end -lrb- which i believe the directions forgot to tell you to add in the first p lace but it is in the ingredient list . -rrb- instead of 1 1/3 cups i add 2 cups . this year i made it with sourdough bread and it turned out divine .	1
This was really good stuffing.... but it would have been better with fresh cranberries. The dried cranberries just didn't give it enough flavor.	this was really good stuffing ... . but it would have been better with fresh cranberries . the dried cranberries just did n't give it enough flavor .	1

To prevent this from being so greasy i cooked the bacon separately and crumbled and tossed together at end. All the ingredients came together nicely. Nice side dish.	to prevent this from being so greasy i cooked the bacon separately and crumbled and tossed together at end . all the ingredients came together nicely . nice side dish .	1
My bacon was pretty 'fatty' so I drained quite a bit of the grease and was still too greasy for us. Think I will try this again drain all the grease add a little butter to the grease 'coating' in the pan and I also think this could use some garlic.	my bacon was pretty ` fatty ' so i drained quite a bit of the grease and was still too greasy for us . think i will try this again drain all the grease add a little butter to the grease ` coating ' in the pan and i also think this could use some garlic .	1
I couldn't even imagine putting the corn into all of that bacon grease so I drained most of it off and was still left with a nicely bacon flavored side.

This was good if you like greasy corn. I did give it two stars because 1)It smelled good and 2)It looked really yummy...nice and colorfull. It tasted like bland greasy corn though. If I ever attempt to make this again I will definatly drain the bacon grease and add some kind of spice.

Hubs and I loved these! It's such a treat when I find a recipe that truly stands out from the ordinary! I found the tiniest Yukon potatoes which were particularly attractive on the plate. The recipe is just perfect as is although the next time I make these I might try a little more horseradish for just a bit more kick. For presentation and a bit of color I sprinkled some finely chopped parsley over the top but fresh minced chives would be equally good. Just delicious!	hubs and i loved these ! it 's such a treat when i find a recipe that truly stands out from the ordinary ! i found the tiniest yukon potatoes which were particularly attractive on the plate . the recipe i s just perfect as is although the next time i make these i might try a little more horseradish for just a bit more kick . for presentation and a bit of color i sprinkled some finely chopped parsley ove r the top but fresh minced chives would be equally good . just delicious !	1

These little potatoes took FOREVER to bake and my sauce ended up burning. So once they were just about done I transferred the potatoes to a new dish and remade the sauce and put them back into the oven. Next time I'll definitely take the advice of other reviewers and cook them in the microwave first and then the oven. The end result however was wonderful.

Wonderful.  The flavor is very unique.  Use real butter - margarine doesn't taste as good.  Recipe says you can just make the sauce and pour over cooked potatoes, but I wouldn't recommend it.  The sauce really needs the hour in the oven for the flavors of the horseradish and lemon to soften and blend.  I've made this three times and will make it many more, I'm sure!	wonderful . the flavor is very unique . use real butter - margarine does n't taste as good . recipe says you can just make the sauce and pour over cooked potatoes , but i would n't recommend it . the sau ce really needs the hour in the oven for the flavors of the horseradish and lemon to soften and blend . i 've made this three times and will make it many more , i 'm sure !	1

A refreshingly different salad. I used raspberries instead of strawberries. The sweetness of the raspberries went well with the mild taste of the dressing. I found that needed flavor was added by roasting the almonds with a bit of sugar and pepper.	a refreshingly different salad . i used raspberries instead of strawberries . the sweetness of the raspberries went well with the mild taste of the dressing . i found that needed flavor was added by roas ting the almonds with a bit of sugar and pepper .	1

REDUCED FAT VERSION Great flavors that work well together. The dressing is awesome but I always look at how can I cut the fat or calories and maintain the full flavor or even bump it a bit. I did this recipe just as described but I swapped out the milk for fat free half and half and added just a dash of water. I also used Mayo which is Olive oil based (Green lid by major brand) cutting all the saturated fat and cutting down on the non-saturated by about half. Last thing I did was to zest the lime with a micro-plane making the finest zest possible and added it to the dressing. Hope that helps for those of us who try to cut out as much fat as possible!	reduced fat version great flavors that work well together . the dressing is awesome but i always look at how can i cut the fat or calories and maintain the full flavor or even bump it a bit . i did this recipe just as described but i swapped out the milk for fat free half and half and added just a dash of water . i also used mayo which is olive oil based -lrb- green lid by major brand -rrb- cutting all the sat urated fat and cutting down on the non-saturated by about half . last thing i did was to zest the lime with a micro-plane making the finest zest possible and added it to the dressing . hope that helps f or those of us who try to cut out as much fat as possible !	1

A very nice very tasty salad. I have made it several times now. Thanks it will turn into one of our regulars. I add about 1/8 of a teaspoon of Ancho Chili powder to the dressing which gives the dressing a little more fullness in flavor. Sometimes I fry up cod in butter with salt pepper fresh garlic and ginger as an accompaniment rather than chicken. It doesn't cube well but the flavors are very complimentary.	a very nice very tasty salad . i have made it several times now . thanks it will turn into one of our regulars . i add about 1/8 of a teaspoon of ancho chili powder to the dressing which gives the dressi ng a little more fullness in flavor . sometimes i fry up cod in butter with salt pepper fresh garlic and ginger as an accompaniment rather than chicken . it does n't cube well but the flavors are very co mplimentary .	1

So tasty, so easy, so great!!  I've made this three times (for a houseful of company each time), and it's always a hit. (It's also really nice to be able to visit in the morning instead of standing at the stove.) These are generous servings, and thank goodness - everyone goes for seconds!  I've tried the half regular/half sage sausage combo as suggested, but my favorite is to just use Jimmy Dean Maple flavor sausage - HEAVENLY.

This is wonderful on a cold December morning especially at Christmas. The bread does not have to be toasted or cut up. You can just cut the crusts off and make one layer on the bottom of the baking dish and pour the egg mixture over it. I sometimes saute chopped onion with the sausage also have added mushrooms. I always serve with side of picante and sour cream but not necessary.	this is wonderful on a cold december morning especially at christmas . the bread does not have to be toasted or cut up . you can just cut the crusts off and make one layer on the bottom of the baking di sh and pour the egg mixture over it . i sometimes saute chopped onion with the sausage also have added mushrooms . i always serve with side of picante and sour cream but not necessary .	1
I prepared this Christmas eve with a few changes from others. I made this with 6 eggs maple sausage. I used 1/2 cup croutons & 6 slices of toated bread. Added about 2 teaspoons green chili's for enough zip & not a lot of hot so my children would eat this. I agree 9x13 makes this to thin. I used a 11x7 & will use a 8x8 or 10x10 next year.

A huge hit on Christmas morning and special brunches at our house! Very hearty and works just as well with 12 ounces of the reduced fat sausage in place of the pound of regular sausage. Be sure to0 LET IT SET OVERNIGHT!!!! Once we were pressed for time and we just mixed it and popped it in the oven and it was mush! Follow the directions and you will love this!

Despite me overcooking the potatoes this was still very good. Being vegetarian I left out the bacon and I also substituted red pepper for green pickled jalapenos for fresh (can't get fresh ones easily here) and Dijon mustard for brown mustard (don't know what that is).

A very good and easy soup. I used a large baking potato so the soup was nice and thick after blending. Also I didn't add the thawed broccoli until the potato was already tender and just cooked it a few minutes more so that the broccoli kept a nice green color and fresh flavor. My family including my 9-yr. old son really liked this soup.	a very good and easy soup . i used a large baking potato so the soup was nice and thick after blending . also i did n't add the thawed broccoli until the potato was already tender and just cooked it a fe w minutes more so that the broccoli kept a nice green color and fresh flavor . my family including my 9 yr . old son really liked this soup .	1
I was worried after reading other reviews of this recipe but gave it a try anyhow because it looked so easy. It turned out terrific!! It was a little bland but I just added some chopped fresh sage and a little season salt and it turned out great! And you can't beat it for healthy. For my husband I stirred a 1/4 c of chopped proscuitto (you could use ham too) into his and he loved it. I also doubled the potato as per previous reviews here and I loved the thick texture. I will definitely put this in our monthly rotation - thanks Lon!	i was worried after reading other reviews of this recipe but gave it a try anyhow because it looked so easy . it turned out terrific !! it was a little bland but i just added some chopped fresh sage and a little season salt and it turned out great ! and you ca n't beat it for healthy . for my husband i stirred a 1/4 c of chopped proscuitto -lrb- you could use ham too -rrb- into his and he loved it . i also double d the potato as per previous reviews here and i loved the thick texture . i will definitely put this in our monthly rotation - thanks lon !	1
This recipe rocks especially if you're obsessed with soup like I am! It's totally easy and totally tweakable. I used fresh broccoli two small red potatoes with the skins on and omitted the nutmeg (had none in the house). I also threw some reduced-fat white cheddar cheese in the bowl and it got all melty and delicious and tasted as good as the Panera broccoli cheddar I love but can no longer eat because it's awful for you.

After reading some great & some not so great reviews I decided to give this soup a try even though my first impression of the ingredients did not appeal to me. Should have stuck with my first impression because I found it very bland and watery. I used fresh broccoli which may have affected it some and left out the nutmeg. After doctoring it up with some cream cheddar cheese and butter and also thickening it with some flour it was much better. This one is not a keeper for me.	after reading some great & some not so great reviews i decided to give this soup a try even though my first impression of the ingredients did not appeal to me . should have stuck with my first impressi on because i found it very bland and watery . i used fresh broccoli which may have affected it some and left out the nutmeg . after doctoring it up with some cream cheddar cheese and butter and also thi ckening it with some flour it was much better . this one is not a keeper for me .	1

I don't think I ever knew real stuffed pepper love until I met these.  Wow.  Other than using red bell peppers I didn't change a thing.  Confusion over when to add the cheese, in the mixture or as a topping, or 1/2 and 1/2.  I added it to the mixture and it was very noticeable and worked out well there.  It would've been difficult to sprinkle on top as there was a LOT of stuffing, so much I piled it as high as I could on each pepper.  Not cooking the meat first seemed stranged to me, but I think this method adds to the flavor and everything cooked to perfect doneness in the time frame given.  Spoon the sauce from the pan on afterwards for flavor and to make it look even tastier.  If you think is good the first night, it's double WOW reheated the next day.	i do n't think i ever knew real stuffed pepper love until i met these . wow . other than using red bell peppers i did n't change a thing . confusion over when to add the cheese , in the mixture or as a t opping , or 1/2 and 1/2 . i added it to the mixture and it was very noticeable and worked out well there . it would 've been difficult to sprinkle on top as there was a lot of stuffing , so much i piled it as high as i could on each pepper . not cooking the meat first seemed stranged to me , but i think this method adds to the flavor and everything cooked to perfect doneness in the time frame given . spoon the sauce from the pan on afterwards for flavor and to make it look even tastier . if you think is good the first night , it 's double wow reheated the next day .	1
I thought this recipe was great.  My family was only so-so about it but they don't care for stuffed peppers at all.  The only complaint I have about the recipe is that made as is, you have way too much filling or not enough peppers.  I used 4 very large bell peppers and still had a ton of filling left over.  I even over over stuffed mine and had extra.  I could have easily stuffed 3-4 more peppers with the filling.  I just cooked the extra filling along with the peppers in the sauce.  Thank you for a very flavorful new spin on the old stuffed pepper!	i thought this recipe was great . my family was only so-so about it but they do n't care for stuffed peppers at all . the only complaint i have about the recipe is that made as is , you have way too muc h filling or not enough peppers . i used 4 very large bell peppers and still had a ton of filling left over . i even over over stuffed mine and had extra . i could have easily stuffed 3 - 4 more peppers with the filling . i just cooked the extra filling along with the peppers in the sauce . thank you for a very flavorful new spin on the old stuffed pepper !	1
Sooooo good sooooo easy & 5 stars all the way. I used light sour cream and Splenda blend and it still was delicious. The pie crust is done in seconds in the food processor is tender and you don't even have to roll it out just press into the pie dish. Absolutely wouldn't change a thing; it's perfect as is.	sooooo good sooooo easy & 5 stars all the way . i used light sour cream and splenda blend and it still was delicious . the pie crust is done in seconds in the food processor is tender and you do n't even have to roll it out just press into the pie dish . absolutely would n't change a thing ; it 's perfect as is .	1
This is my absolute favorite recipe. I'm not a huge pie person but this is definitely the exception to the rule. I can't stop eating it! The pie crust is flakey and buttery and the pie is the perfect balance of tart and sweetness. Although the recipe is simple and easy to make you can tell after the first bite that every ingredient s main purpose is to highlight the natural flavors of the peaches. They key here is to use fresh ripe peaches! Don't use canned or frozen and don't use skim sour cream... there's a reason for each ingredient. If you absolutely must add your own flare I suggest spices such as cinnamon nutmeg etc... but I insist you try it at least once as is you won't be disappointed!	this is my absolute favorite recipe . i 'm not a huge pie person but this is definitely the exception to the rule . i ca n't stop eating it ! the pie crust is flakey and buttery and the pie is the perfect balance of tart and sweetness . although the recipe is simple and easy to make you can tell after the first bite that every ingredient s main purpose is to highlight the natural flavors of the peaches . they key here is to use fresh ripe peaches ! do n't use canned or frozen and do n't use skim sour cream ... there 's a reason for each ingredient . if you absolutely must add your own flare i suggest spice s such as cinnamon nutmeg etc. . . but i insist you try it at least once as is you wo n't be disappointed !	1
I think this may be my first time rating a recipe after several years of getting great recipes from this site. I have to tell you though.... This pie is WONDERFUL! Don't forget to try with vanilla ice cream - yummy! Sounds really strange to put sour cream in a peach pie but it works beautifully. I fully intended to give half of it away but my husband wouldn't let me. I can't believe we ate the whole thing! I'm making it again this weekend for 4th of July and I'm certain it will become a Thanksgiving staple. We had hundreds of peaches from a tree in the back yard; Thanks to gent500 for the great recipe. Perfect.	i think this may be my first time rating a recipe after several years of getting great recipes from this site . i have to tell you though ... . this pie is wonderful ! do n't forget to try with vanilla ice cream - yummy ! sounds really strange to put sour cream in a peach pie but it works beautifully . i fully intended to give half of it away but my husband would n't let me . i ca n't believe we ate the who le thing ! i 'm making it again this weekend for 4 th of july and i 'm certain it will become a thanksgiving staple . we had hundreds of peaches from a tree in the back yard ; thanks to gent500 for the grea t recipe . perfect .	1
I'm not a pie maker but I loved this recipe. I've made it three times now. I finally switched from flour to cornstarch for the filling which kept coming out runny. Also tried mixing 1-2 tablespoons if cornstarch into peaches after I cut them into smaller bite size pieces. Also have used filling in a prepared pie crust..hubby loves it.	i 'm not a pie maker but i loved this recipe . i 've made it three times now . i finally switched from flour to cornstarch for the filling which kept coming out runny . also tried mixing 1 - 2 tablespoons if cornstarch into peaches after i cut them into smaller bite size pieces . also have used filling in a prepared pie crust . . hubby loves it .	1

Subsituted with fat free sour cream and doing exactly as directions pie never cooked to firmness..I baked literally for 2 1/2 hrs even used speed bake for last half hour. Still was soggy inside. But It did have a great taste. Maybe fat free sour cream was the problem.	subsituted with fat free sour cream and doing exactly as directions pie never cooked to firmness . . i baked literally for 2 1/2 hrs even used speed bake for last half hour . still was soggy inside . but i t did have a great taste . maybe fat free sour cream was the problem .	1
Bravo,this is a wonderful recipie...I took a hint from a Gourmet magazine recipie and added grated rind of a lemon. In addition, I made the cream cheese icing with grated lemon rind and lemon juice..this cut the sweetness of the cake and gave it a glorious citrus flavour!!!!!!!!!	bravo , this is a wonderful recipie ... i took a hint from a gourmet magazine recipie and added grated rind of a lemon . in addition , i made the cream cheese icing with grated lemon rind and lemon juice . . t his cut the sweetness of the cake and gave it a glorious citrus flavour !!!!!!!!!	1

This is my pancake recipe now. However I do not use butter. I substitute 1/4c canola oil (or sometimes unsweetened applesauce. If I double I use 1/4c each). I also use 1 egg and 2 egg whites instead of 3 eggs. Since I don't usually have buttermilk I use soured milk (add tbs lemon juice or vinegar to your milk). I gradually add the liquid until the batter is the right consistency since it tends to be thin. I throw in a tbs or two of ground flax seed for a little added nutrition. I usually double this recipe and freeze the extras. They warm up great in the toaster. They're also great if you add blueberries.	this is my pancake recipe now . however i do not use butter . i substitute 1/4 c canola oil -lrb- or sometimes unsweetened applesauce . if i double i use 1/4 c each -rrb- . i also use 1 egg and 2 egg whites instead o f 3 eggs . since i do n't usually have buttermilk i use soured milk -lrb- add tbs lemon juice or vinegar to your milk -rrb- . i gradually add the liquid until the batter is the right consistency since it tends to be thin . i throw in a tbs or two of ground flax seed for a little added nutrition . i usually double this recipe and freeze the extras . they warm up great in the toaster . they 're also great if you add blueberries .	1
I used the lemon juice/1% milk substitution for buttermilk (1 tablespoon lemon juice for each cup of milk). I also substituted cinnamon applesauce for butter. When I was a kid I preferred thin pancakes but these raise high and were also delicious. The recipe provides a somewhat healthy way to indulge.

"Jen thanks for the great recipe! The pancakes turned out fluffy and light just as advertised! I didn't measure any of the ingredients directly (I ususlly go by 'feel' when cooking). Because of this I wasn't too concerned about the fact that baking soda was missing from the ingredients list but was called for in the body of the recipe... If you want to make this recipe and you are going to use buttermilk do not forget to use the baking soda! I think I put about a 3/4"" of a teaspoon in. I also didn't have any buttermilk but I found that if you put about 2tsp of regular vinegar in whole or 2% milk it will cause the milk to curdle slightly and will closely resemble buttermilk. (By the way you can't even begin to taste the vinegar in the final pancakes after baking.) I've added this recipe to my box and will now make it my mainstay for making pancakes!"	jen thanks for the great recipe ! the pancakes turned out fluffy and light just as advertised ! i did n't measure any of the ingredients directly -lrb- i ususlly go by ` feel ' when cooking -rrb- . because of this i was n't too concerned about the fact that baking soda was missing from the ingredients list but was called for in the body of the recipe ... if you want to make this recipe and you are going to use butt ermilk do not forget to use the baking soda ! i think i put about a 3/4 '' of a teaspoon in . i also did n't have any buttermilk but i found that if you put about 2 tsp of regular vinegar in whole or 2 % mil k it will cause the milk to curdle slightly and will closely resemble buttermilk . -lrb- by the way you ca n't even begin to taste the vinegar in the final pancakes after baking . -rrb- i 've added this recipe to m y box and will now make it my mainstay for making pancakes !	1
I made these pancakes for Easter breakfast and everyone loved them! My father-in-law could not stop eating them. I did change the recipe a little....gound up in my coffee grinder a little flaxseed wheat bulgar and wheat germ and used it in place of the white flour and then through in a small handfull of the whole flaxseed and bulgar for a little crunch. I also went light on the buttermilk and added a teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla..... best pancakes I have ever had....and by the way froze the leftovers and popped them in the toaster...came our great!	i made these pancakes for easter breakfast and everyone loved them ! my father-in-law could not stop eating them . i did change the recipe a little ... gound up in my coffee grinder a little flaxseed whe at bulgar and wheat germ and used it in place of the white flour and then through in a small handfull of the whole flaxseed and bulgar for a little crunch . i also went light on the buttermilk and adde d a teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla ... . best pancakes i have ever had ... and by the way froze the leftovers and popped them in the toaster ... came our great !	1
I found out that if you use a pastry brush to brush oil onto the pan in the shape of any alphabet the impression gets onto the pancake when done. Amazing!The recipe is great eventhough i made a few alterations like using whole wheat flour baking powder salt in the ratio of 2 cups: 1 tablespoon: 1teaspoon & lesser sugar.I used the butter milk but avoided the butter in the batter.	i found out that if you use a pastry brush to brush oil onto the pan in the shape of any alphabet the impression gets onto the pancake when done . amazing!the recipe is great eventhough i made a few al terations like using whole wheat flour baking powder salt in the ratio of 2 cups : 1 tablespoon : 1 teaspoon & lesser sugar.i used the butter milk but avoided the butter in the batter .	1
I made these for my husband's birthday yesterday and they turned out great. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1/2 vanilla yoghurt and 1/2 skim milk (healthier that way too). I added blueberries to some pancakes chocolate chips to some and nothing to the others and they were all yummy! I was a little concerned though about the amount of butter. I think next time I'll try to cut down the butter and sub some applesauce instead.

These are the best! My 3yr old is a pancake freak so I made these for a healthy breakfast and she loves them. I cut out or haf the butter and I never have buttermilk so I just add 1% milk and it turns out fine. I also added oats last time.

This was the first time I made pancakes from scratch (I always use the boxed Bisquick powder). I wanted to try a recipe that tasted more like restaurant pancakes. The batter is quite thick and I found they were harder to flip being so heavy. All of the butter made them greasier than I like but the butter flavor was very good. I sprayed my griddle with cooking spray knowing these already had so much butter. I followed the recipe exactly although my son wanted chocolate chips in his and I used white whole wheat flour. My son wasn't crazy about these at all. I liked the flavor but they were just too greasy and dense. I do think these could be great with some changes though. I am going to experiment with canola oil and applesauce next time and just put a little butter on top of the finished pancake for flavor. I will also substitute some of the buttermilk for skim milk and see if this helps. If you want a very filling pancake these will really stick by you and I love the use of whole wheat flour and wheat germ.	this was the first time i made pancakes from scratch -lrb- i always use the boxed bisquick powder -rrb- . i wanted to try a recipe that tasted more like restaurant pancakes . the batter is quite thick and i found they were harder to flip being so heavy . all of the butter made them greasier than i like but the butter flavor was very good . i sprayed my griddle with cooking spray knowing these already had so muc h butter . i followed the recipe exactly although my son wanted chocolate chips in his and i used white whole wheat flour . my son was n't crazy about these at all . i liked the flavor but they were just too greasy and dense . i do think these could be great with some changes though . i am going to experiment with canola oil and applesauce next time and just put a little butter on top of the finished pa ncake for flavor . i will also substitute some of the buttermilk for skim milk and see if this helps . if you want a very filling pancake these will really stick by you and i love the use of whole wheat flour and wheat germ .	1

Excellent base recipe. I made a few modifications and this came out superb! First off instead of steaming the broccoli in a steamer I added it to a saute pan with a little bit of water (maybe a 1/2 cup) a tablespoon of butter and some minced garlic. When I sauteed the mushrooms I added a little bit of fresh spinach (about 2 cups/handfuls). I also added a few pinches of Marjoram Basil Thyme and parsley paste (in substitute for fresh parsley). Instead of putting the dry mustard in the dough I added it to the cream mixture since I bought a pre-made crust. When it came time to add the egg I added one extra to equal four. Turned out fantastic! One of the best recipes I've used from this site in a while!

I've made this a few times and it's a family favorite.  It tastes sooo good.  I modified the recipe only slightly.  For the crust I used 1/4 tsp. salt instead of 1/2 tsp.  I thought it was too salty.  Also for the filling, I substituted light cream for the half-and-half, and added a dash of pepper.	i 've made this a few times and it 's a family favorite . it tastes sooo good . i modified the recipe only slightly . for the crust i used 1/4 tsp . salt instead of 1/2 tsp . i thought it was too salty . also for the filling , i substituted light cream for the half-and-half , and added a dash of pepper .	1
This was a yummy way to use the broccoli from my garden and the eggs from my sister's chickens! I do agree however that the crust seemed salty -- I will reduce it by half the next time I make it. But overall it was really good and different from just a plain old quiche.	this was a yummy way to use the broccoli from my garden and the eggs from my sister 's chickens ! i do agree however that the crust seemed salty -- i will reduce it by half the next time i make it . but overall it was really good and different from just a plain old quiche .	1
This was good and my husband liked it. I didn't have chedder substituted colby-jack instead. The crust didn't taste real cheesy but very rich. I cooked the onions in the microwave to reduce dirty dishes. I did not add mushrooms -my husband dislikes- but added the last of some turkey bacon. I also added 2% milk instead of cream which was fine. Could have used a touch more salt or seasoning in the eggs. I will make this again though.	this was good and my husband liked it . i did n't have chedder substituted colby-jack instead . the crust did n't taste real cheesy but very rich . i cooked the onions in the microwave to reduce dirty dish es . i did not add mushrooms - my husband dislikes - but added the last of some turkey bacon . i also added 2 % milk instead of cream which was fine . could have used a touch more salt or seasoning in the e ggs . i will make this again though .	1

Fantastic! My only variations are to use 8 large chicken thighs (skin on to reduce prep and cleanup time) substitute a dry red wine for the water and use 1 cup of Barilla Marinara for the tomato sauce. NOTE: after browning all the thighs it s a good idea to drain most of the fat before proceeding. I serve over buttered wide egg noodles.	fantastic ! my only variations are to use 8 large chicken thighs -lrb- skin on to reduce prep and cleanup time -rrb- substitute a dry red wine for the water and use 1 cup of barilla marinara for the tomato sauce . note : after browning all the thighs it s a good idea to drain most of the fat before proceeding . i serve over buttered wide egg noodles .	1

Very good! Used my homemade sauce. I always make a big batch & freeze it in 2 cup batches so I'm always ready when I get the urge to cook. I too spiced it up a little more. Had 2 zucchini that were just about ready for zucchini heaven so I threw them in too slced of course. I have a new electric pressure cooker so next time I'll make this in my P.C. and let you all know how it turns out.	very good ! used my homemade sauce . i always make a big batch & freeze it in 2 cup batches so i 'm always ready when i get the urge to cook . i too spiced it up a little more . had 2 zucchini that were ju st about ready for zucchini heaven so i threw them in too slced of course . i have a new electric pressure cooker so next time i 'll make this in my p.c. and let you all know how it turns out .	1
I made this as written except I used chicken thighs. In the video, I thought he said to keep all the chicken run-off after browning. I wish I would have stuck with my mind and drained it. The meal was so greasy I couldn't taste anything else. If you make this with thighs, PLEASE drain it before putting everything else in. It was a waste of food in my house.	i made this as written except i used chicken thighs . in the video , i thought he said to keep all the chicken run-off after browning . i wish i would have stuck with my mind and drained it . the meal was so greasy i could n't taste anything else . if you make this with thighs , please drain it before putting everything else in . it was a waste of food in my house .	1

UUUMMMM!!! That was probably the best variation of macaroni salad I have tried. I excluded the chicken because I was serving it with a meal and didn't think I needed it but it would be a great meal on its own with the chicken. Definitely heed the advice about letting it sit overnight though. I had to test when it was first made and have to say I was not impressed but once it sat yummy!	uuummmm !!! that was probably the best variation of macaroni salad i have tried . i excluded the chicken because i was serving it with a meal and did n't think i needed it but it would be a great meal on its own with the chicken . definitely heed the advice about letting it sit overnight though . i had to test when it was first made and have to say i was not impressed but once it sat yummy !	1

Yummy recipe! I used 1/2 the celery because my hubby isn't a big celery fan and I opted for baked chunks of chicken instead of the canned.I had him try it cold - and then he heated it up in the microwave just to see how it was warmed.

I made a few changes but really liked this salad. I used small shells instead of elbow macaroni. I also added a couple of chopped green onions. Used leftover chopped turkey instead of canned chicken. Because I found it a little too salty initially I increased the turkey to 2 cups and added 2 diced hard-boiled eggs and that seemed to take care of it. Served it on a bed of lettuce with cherry tomatoes as a garnish.

I changed a few things... use apples instead of pears as that was all I had, used Jack Daniels instead of Irish Whiskey, walnuts instead of hazelnuts and used chicken boullion instead of just water. I also tripled the whiskey amount, as my husband and I both love the taste of whiskey and the dish was not overpoweringly whiskey tasting. It was perfect!

"Made this tonight on a whim to use some sweet potatoes I had. I used some drumsticks instead just because I had them and it was great. 

 It was delicious! I would however make a few adjustments next time. I loved the pears and would add another. I would also double the spinach, since it cooks down so much.

I hate when people rate recipes after they've altered it, but I'm sure the original is just as good, if not better, than the version I made.  Based on what I had on hand, I used granny smith apples instead of pears, omitted the whiskey, and used toasted almonds instead of hazelnuts.  It was delicious!  Next time I will make it as written to see which version is better, but I'll leave the chicken out because I don't think it adds anything.	i hate when people rate recipes after they 've altered it , but i 'm sure the original is just as good , if not better , than the version i made . based on what i had on hand , i used granny smith apples in stead of pears , omitted the whiskey , and used toasted almonds instead of hazelnuts . it was delicious ! next time i will make it as written to see which version is better , but i 'll leave the chicken o ut because i do n't think it adds anything .	1

Good flavors but I felt like it was missing some depth. I'll add more whiskey next time and maybe chicken stock instead of water.

Tastes like a hash with sweet potatoes rather mushy and spinachy... Don't like sweet potato and spinach combo....just my opinion.

This was good and close to authentic jerk flavor. I used habaneros as written but think it would be better with scotch bonnet peppers.

I made this recipe last summer and everyone loved it however hubby wanted it to have more flavor. So last weekend when whole pork loins were on sale I bought one and put it in my slow cooker with the marinade. The house smelled so good. When I was ready to serve I pulled it apart some but not completely. Served with beans and rice and everyone raved how good it was. Best of all it looked and tasted just like the jerk pork hubby gets at his favorite restaurant.

This was really easy!! Yay!! I was nervous because this was my first souffle. I doubled the recipe with the exception of the eggs. (I only used one extra because I ran out. It still worked.) The only thing I would add is more asparagus than called for. I will most definitely cook this again.	this was really easy !! yay !! i was nervous because this was my first souffle . i doubled the recipe with the exception of the eggs . -lrb- i only used one extra because i ran out . it still worked . -rrb- the only thing i would add is more asparagus than called for . i will most definitely cook this again .	1
This is delicious! I modified it as follows: instead of adding the pinch of cayenne, i added two teaspoons of hot curry powder and i used a whole clove of garlic.... the flavor was incredible and will def make it again!	this is delicious ! i modified it as follows : instead of adding the pinch of cayenne , i added two teaspoons of hot curry powder and i used a whole clove of garlic ... . the flavor was incredible and will def make it again !	1
My friend made this for Xmas dinner last night. It was delicious!! The texture is really light and a nice compliment to the heavy meat also we had. She served with red beets and the colors were beautifully festive!! The left overs i got to take home are still delicious. I'm going to try to make this at home.

This was fantastic - I placed phyllo dough squares in a muffin pan and then poured souffle in the cups - made for an awesome looking veg dish that was delicious.	this was fantastic - i placed phyllo dough squares in a muffin pan and then poured souffle in the cups - made for an awesome looking veg dish that was delicious .	1
I am very much a beginner cook just retired husband. This will be one of my keeper recipes though. Used broccoli instead of asparagus put way too much in added extra cheese didn't have ramikens so used a big casserole dish....it still worked out! Had to cook twice as long but hey - understandable.

After reading this recipe I went to the store bought the ingredients and made it the same day. My husband and I loved it. I modified the recipe slightly with more garlic (two cloves which was a little too much even for us garlic lovers)and half whipping cream and half milk. I think I would have liked a little more salt. Also this is a great elegant side dish for a company meal.	after reading this recipe i went to the store bought the ingredients and made it the same day . my husband and i loved it . i modified the recipe slightly with more garlic -lrb- two cloves which was a little too much even for us garlic lovers -rrb- and half whipping cream and half milk . i think i would have liked a little more salt . also this is a great elegant side dish for a company meal .	1

Not sure what happened we've made souffles before. But this one fell drastically and the texture wasn't right - kind of mushy. We tried baking one longer but that didn't firm it up. The flavor wasn't good either - very bland should have added salt and more garlic. The egg and asparagus didn't complement each other at all. Won't try this again.	not sure what happened we 've made souffles before . but this one fell drastically and the texture was n't right - kind of mushy . we tried baking one longer but that did n't firm it up . the flavor was n't good either - very bland should have added salt and more garlic . the egg and asparagus did n't complement each other at all . wo n't try this again .	1
I was very much looking forward to trying this recipe for me but to my surprise my hubby instantly fell in love with this and he doesn't even like bell peppers of any color. First bite in and he was praising it like he has only done a few others from this site. Don't get me wrong he enjoys many from here but this one really stood out to him to the point he was talking about it the rest of the night and already asking when we would have it again. This recipe is great hot or cold and I agree with him in the fact it should be part of our regular rotation. I added green onion to the top because we like it so much and it was good but not necessary. All of the flavors blend splendidly with one another in this and I wouldn't change a thing.

This was a very delicious recipe! I made it exactly as written. I would suggest that for the amount of dressing I would use a scant cup of orzo or even a little less because it did need a little more dressing. A little garlic in the dressing would have worked well too. Serving it in the pepper was a nice idea but totally not necessary. Actually I might even just dice up a quarter of the pepper and add it to the salad. It just depends on your presentation. I was thinking that adding a quarter cup of toasted pine nuts would have been perfect with this! You can see that this is a versatile idea that will become part of your cooking repertoire. Thanks for posting geranium! UPDATE: I microwaved the little bit of the leftover pasta the next night and it was delicious served warm too!	this was a very delicious recipe ! i made it exactly as written . i would suggest that for the amount of dressing i would use a scant cup of orzo or even a little less because it did need a little more dressing . a little garlic in the dressing would have worked well too . serving it in the pepper was a nice idea but totally not necessary . actually i might even just dice up a quarter of the pepper and add it to the salad . it just depends on your presentation . i was thinking that adding a quarter cup of toasted pine nuts would have been perfect with this ! you can see that this is a versatile idea t hat will become part of your cooking repertoire . thanks for posting geranium ! update : i microwaved the little bit of the leftover pasta the next night and it was delicious served warm too !	1
Very good salad either hot or cold. I did make a few changes though; I think it would have been better with a little fresh parsley & I did not serve mine in red pepper cups.

This was great for a hot summer super. I used the breast meat from a store bought roasted chicken and kalamata olives. I added a half of a large cucumber seeded and chopped and 4 green onions sliced very thin. The flavors were great and the dressing was just the right amount--not too heavy but flavorful enough to know it was there. This will be a summer staple.	this was great for a hot summer super . i used the breast meat from a store bought roasted chicken and kalamata olives . i added a half of a large cucumber seeded and chopped and 4 green onions sliced v ery thin . the flavors were great and the dressing was just the right amount -- not too heavy but flavorful enough to know it was there . this will be a summer staple .	1

Hi all I just made this & it's in the fridge cooling. I didn't want the chicken just wanted a nice side dish. I won't serve in the pepper cups though its a nice presentation for sure. I didnt have tomatoes so I used 1/2 can of diced with jalapenos instead but would be better with fresh I know. When I made the dressing I just added 3/4 tsp Italian seasoning instead of basil & oregano & a dash of lemon juice. My husband who didn't understand what a Orzo salad was just said mmmm when I gave him a sample:-)	hi all i just made this & it 's in the fridge cooling . i did n't want the chicken just wanted a nice side dish . i wo n't serve in the pepper cups though its a nice presentation for sure . i didnt have tom atoes so i used 1/2 can of diced with jalapenos instead but would be better with fresh i know . when i made the dressing i just added 3/4 tsp italian seasoning instead of basil & oregano & a dash of le mon juice . my husband who did n't understand what a orzo salad was just said mmmm when i gave him a sample :--rrb-	1

I really wanted to love this but it turned out the dijon was too powerful for me taking over the great flavors of the other ingredients. I knew it was risky for me not liking Dijon but my husband loves dijon so I knew it work out -- he thought it was great.

I used arugula rather than spinach (I had everything else on hand) and that was the only major change I made. The olive oil I used was lemon olive oil and I used leftover beer butt chicken rather than grilled. I toasted the pine nuts (put them in a pan on stovetop in low heat until barely browned). We thought this was delicious. The only thing I would worry about would be that there wasn't enough of that wonderful dressing. I'm not sure because I made such a small batch and we didn't even eat all of that but I would want a little more dressing than it called for so maybe a recipe and a half of that? It'd be good on any other salad so that would work for me!

I have made this a dozen times and everyone always loves it and asks for the recipe.

Succulent and chicken breast are seldom found in the same sentence, but you can find them together here in this delightfully simple recipe, composed of a few common ingredients.   Chef John really shows off the flavor of chicken and mushrooms.  Yes, you may add more things, like wine, or aromatics, but the more additions, the more complications and subbing, and then the tweaking begins!  I chose not to view the video beforehand, just to check out the instructions and the cooking times.  I went on the low side of the recommended times, and the chicken came out perfectly, with rich, delicious mushrooms.  We really enjoyed our Sunday chicken today!	succulent and chicken breast are seldom found in the same sentence , but you can find them together here in this delightfully simple recipe , composed of a few common ingredients . chef john really sho ws off the flavor of chicken and mushrooms . yes , you may add more things , like wine , or aromatics , but the more additions , the more complications and subbing , and then the tweaking begins ! i chose n ot to view the video beforehand , just to check out the instructions and the cooking times . i went on the low side of the recommended times , and the chicken came out perfectly , with rich , delicious mu shrooms . we really enjoyed our sunday chicken today !	1
I followed this recipe to the T, and it came out delicious! It was simple, quick, and had only a few main ingredients so I didn't have to go to the store to get anything off hand.

Got this recipe from a top NY chef with one twist: rub skin side with your favorite pork/chicken rub ( grab one from the store-Stonewall great) then sprinkle on other side when chick is skin down. Fab favor and sauce.

Excellent! I’m on a special low acid diet and this fit the bill. I did not use boneless chicken breasts because I believe that the marrow in the bones add flavor. I used a cast iron skillet instead of a stainless steel skillet and it reduced the time of caramelizing the mushrooms in half. I’m a seasoned cook and I always want to add something like wine or whatever to pan jus. I watched Chef John’s video of this recipe and I think that I saw him sneak in some cayenne pepper in the video. Chef John always has cayenne pepper in his recipes and I’d bet that he adds it to his oatmeal in the morning. :) I served this with Sarah’s Rice Pilaf recipe that is posted on this site and with green beans as the 2nd side dish. It was a delicious meal.	excellent ! i 'm on a special low acid diet and this fit the bill . i did not use boneless chicken breasts because i believe that the marrow in the bones add flavor . i used a cast iron skillet instead of a stainless steel skillet and it reduced the time of caramelizing the mushrooms in half . i 'm a seasoned cook and i always want to add something like wine or whatever to pan jus . i watched chef john 's video of this recipe and i think that i saw him sneak in some cayenne pepper in the video . chef john always has cayenne pepper in his recipes and i 'd bet that he adds it to his oatmeal in the morning . :-rrb- i served this with sarah 's rice pilaf recipe that is posted on this site and with green beans as the 2 nd side dish . it was a delicious meal .	1
The challenge factor made me curious, so I had to try it. The meat was good, tender and cooked through. The accompanying sauce, however, was unrelentingly bland..  To increase the flavor, simply using chicken stock in place of water would represent a huge leap forward in sensory quality. I mean, if adding butter was acceptable, why not stock? An interesting culinary exercise, however.	the challenge factor made me curious , so i had to try it . the meat was good , tender and cooked through . the accompanying sauce , however , was unrelentingly bland . . to increase the flavor , simply using chicken stock in place of water would represent a huge leap forward in sensory quality . i mean , if adding butter was acceptable , why not stock ? an interesting culinary exercise , however .	1
Delicious soup and very easy! This will be perfect this summer when everyone's garden is overflowing with zucchini! The only change I made (not by choice) was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken because I didn't realize I was out! Keep in mind this is why it may be a little bit darker in my picture. Still delicious though! I used an immersion blender and blended everything right in the pot instead of using my blender.

Loved this!! So flavorful. I made it almost exactly to the recipe with a few minor changes. I had to add a couple of yellow squash to the zucchini to make the 8 cups. I also added minced garlic while boiling the veggies. The only other thing different was to add some dry dill and a couple of splashes of half and half I had on hand. That made it a little creamier. However I tried it before I did that and it was still amazing. This will definitely go into the rotation.	loved this !! so flavorful . i made it almost exactly to the recipe with a few minor changes . i had to add a couple of yellow squash to the zucchini to make the 8 cups . i also added minced garlic while boiling the veggies . the only other thing different was to add some dry dill and a couple of splashes of half and half i had on hand . that made it a little creamier . however i tried it before i did th at and it was still amazing . this will definitely go into the rotation .	1
A great way to use up those zucchini and summer squash! I thought this was a lot of veggies--it was a lot of soup! Will be freezing it for later.

Very good. I sliced three regular size carrots into 1/8th inch rounds and used the recipe set to 1 serving. I also didn't have lemon juice so I used about an 1/8th of a teaspoon of lemon extract.

I don't know who decided that carrots side dishes had to be covered in butter, honey, and sugar, but this recipe was a welcome relief.  I've made this with both fresh and dried dill.

Perfection!!! One of the few recipes that make me wish there were more stars to pass out. Incredible not-too-sweet coffee cake! Only made a minor change: a bit more sugar and a splash of vanilla in the cream cheese layer. It is an extremely sticky dough so wet hands help a lot when spreading it out. I think it's best room temperature. I found that if this is stored in a tightly covered container it gets more moist as it sits making it even better the next day! Thanks so much! (I noticed one reviewer said the butter made it too salty-I was taught to always use unsalted butter when baking...this allows the cook to be in control of the saltiness of the end product.)	perfection !!! one of the few recipes that make me wish there were more stars to pass out . incredible not-too-sweet coffee cake ! only made a minor change : a bit more sugar and a splash of vanilla in th e cream cheese layer . it is an extremely sticky dough so wet hands help a lot when spreading it out . i think it 's best room temperature . i found that if this is stored in a tightly covered container i t gets more moist as it sits making it even better the next day ! thanks so much ! -lrb- i noticed one reviewer said the butter made it too salty-i was taught to always use unsalted butter when baking ... this allows the cook to be in control of the saltiness of the end product . -rrb-	1
This coffee cake is moist and delicious. It tastes amazing fresh out of the oven or chilled and even tastes good the next day. I cut the recipe down to 1/3 and baked it in a glass bread pan because I was only cooking breakfast for two and it worked out great. I will be making this for a crowd Christmas morning.

Made this for Recipe Group...DELICIOUS! Made this exactly as written and it turned out wonderfully. The 'hardest' part was spreading the dough into the bottom of the pan but that was easily helped along w/ my hand and some cooking spray. Very simple to make and I liked the fact that it's not overly sweet just right! This makes a nice big cake so it's enough to feed a crowd. This would even be great w/ some fruit preserves added to the middle as well (not that it needs it b/c it doesn't). A definite keeper YUM!

Made for Recipe Group. We love cream cheese danish this fits the bill nicely. Moist and crunchy! I patted the bottom layer out with wet fingers spread the cheese layer over and put the second batter part between wax paper and patted it out then laid over the top. Worked great with a little help from some wet hands to get it off the paper. Baked up nicely. Had it warm and cold. I liked it both ways.

Great bread recipe! My husband couldn't stop raving about it! I think he may have enjoyed it somewhat since I made this recipe into 10 dinner rolls and he ate five of them! Instead of butter I used two tablespoons of garlic flavored olive oil. Left out marjoram and used fresh rosemary from the herb garden.Mmmm Good.	great bread recipe ! my husband could n't stop raving about it ! i think he may have enjoyed it somewhat since i made this recipe into 10 dinner rolls and he ate five of them ! instead of butter i used tw o tablespoons of garlic flavored olive oil . left out marjoram and used fresh rosemary from the herb garden.mmmm good .	1
This bread tastes really great but I wouldn't recommend baking it in a breadmaker. Just like a previous reviewer mine fluffed so vigorously it stuck to the inside lid and half of this yummy loaf was scraped off into the sink!

This was a family favorite! Simple flavorful and extraordinarily fluffy. I'll probably use a little less yeast in future as the bread grew until it pressed the top of the machine but keeping everyone on tiptoes and out of the kitchen prevented any falling so the end product had a wonderful airy texture. I also added garlic (1 teaspoon) and substituted Romano cheese (4 tablespoons for even more flavor) for Parmesan. Went perfectly with tomato basil soup and club sandwiches!	this was a family favorite ! simple flavorful and extraordinarily fluffy . i 'll probably use a little less yeast in future as the bread grew until it pressed the top of the machine but keeping everyone on tiptoes and out of the kitchen prevented any falling so the end product had a wonderful airy texture . i also added garlic -lrb- 1 teaspoon -rrb- and substituted romano cheese -lrb- 4 tablespoons for even more fla vor -rrb- for parmesan . went perfectly with tomato basil soup and club sandwiches !	1

This was delicious! My local grocery stores carry sun-dried tomato pesto in the deli and in the pasta sauce aisle (Classico makes a good one) so check both places in case you have trouble locating it. My husband loved this I loved this and the friends I made it for also loved it--you really can't go wrong! Next time I'll use chicken instead of steak but this is a recipe I'll make many more times in the future.

I could not find sun-dried tomato pesto at the store so I made my own with a combination of minced sun-dried tomatoes and pesto paste. Not as good as the real thing I am sure but still very tasty! Made a few changes: Used NY Strip steaks instead of rib-eye (delicious!) sauteed the spinach in garlic and olive oil before adding to pasta. Omitted olives added chopped onion and portabella mushroom to the steak instead of shallots. Used fresh grated parmesan cheese instead of feta. Definitely more of an italian taste than greek but was very delicious! Much lighter than I had expected. I will make this again and keep experimenting.	i could not find sun-dried tomato pesto at the store so i made my own with a combination of minced sun-dried tomatoes and pesto paste . not as good as the real thing i am sure but still very tasty ! mad e a few changes : used ny strip steaks instead of rib-eye -lrb- delicious ! -rrb- sauteed the spinach in garlic and olive oil before adding to pasta . omitted olives added chopped onion and portabella mushroom to the steak instead of shallots . used fresh grated parmesan cheese instead of feta . definitely more of an italian taste than greek but was very delicious ! much lighter than i had expected . i will make t his again and keep experimenting .	1
This was amazing--I was nervous about using sun-dried tomato pesto (we've never tried it) but it gave such a rich depth to the steak. When my husband came in he said it smelled like a restaurant. It was fun to make and unbelievably good with simple ingredients. I left out the olives and used asiago romano & parmesan cheese instead of the feta but I want to try it with feta. I had a bagged salad I needed to use so I served the pasta/steak mixture on a bed of greens and it was so good even down to the crunch of the sunflower seeds. Fantastic recipe Jennifer!	this was amazing -- i was nervous about using sun-dried tomato pesto -lrb- we 've never tried it -rrb- but it gave such a rich depth to the steak . when my husband came in he said it smelled like a restaurant . it w as fun to make and unbelievably good with simple ingredients . i left out the olives and used asiago romano & parmesan cheese instead of the feta but i want to try it with feta . i had a bagged salad i needed to use so i served the pasta/steak mixture on a bed of greens and it was so good even down to the crunch of the sunflower seeds . fantastic recipe jennifer !	1

This is so good. I have made this twice already and love it! I leave out the black olives but that is personal preference. Also the only sun-dried tomato pesto I could find (after searching 3 supermarkets) is made by Classico. The jar is small about half the size of typical spaghetti sauces and will probably be on the top shelf. The pesto is amazing making the dish to die for!

I'm rating this based on flavor combination rather than cooking method because I prepared it differently than directed. I substituted leftover turkey so did not need to prepare chicken. Also I oven roasted my butternut squash and pecans. I added a chopped sweet onion to the mix when I roasted the squash. I really enjoyed the flavors together and will use this again after Thanksgiving.	i 'm rating this based on flavor combination rather than cooking method because i prepared it differently than directed . i substituted leftover turkey so did not need to prepare chicken . also i oven ro asted my butternut squash and pecans . i added a chopped sweet onion to the mix when i roasted the squash . i really enjoyed the flavors together and will use this again after thanksgiving .	1
I like versatile recipes and chose this recipe as a way to use up some leftover roast chicken and a different way to prepare Winter squash besides roasting or boiling. I also wanted a make ahead meal. I modified it by leaving the quinoa and goat cheese separate from the squash/nut/chicken mixture so that we could make up our own bowl to our taste. I found this warm recipe ticked all the boxes for sweet savory crunchy soft and comfort-food-like all -in -one-one-bowl goodness. Next time I'll add a green veggie on the side or a salad. Looking forward to trying it as a cold salad with balsamic as suggested.	i like versatile recipes and chose this recipe as a way to use up some leftover roast chicken and a different way to prepare winter squash besides roasting or boiling . i also wanted a make ahead meal . i modified it by leaving the quinoa and goat cheese separate from the squash/nut/chicken mixture so that we could make up our own bowl to our taste . i found this warm recipe ticked all the boxes for sweet savory crunchy soft and comfort-food-like all - in - one-one-bowl goodness . next time i 'll add a green veggie on the side or a salad . looking forward to trying it as a cold salad with balsamic as suggested .	1

I love this recipe. I tried it out and it was so tasty. I could eat this over and over again. I don't always use olives and tomatoes seems like it might be overkill but when cooking the chicken I use sesame seed oil rice wine vinegar and some soy sauce as well as a bit of powdered ginger for a boost of flavor for the chicken all by itself.

My Mom and Dad really liked this but I just thought it was OK. I kept thinking that it needed something like maybe some buffalo mozzeralla cut into cubes but both of my parents thought it was great as it was. We used 1 cup of chicken from a rotisserie chicken. I mixed the veggies with the dressing and put it in the fridge for an hour or so before we were ready to serve. I also cooked the pasta drained it and put it in the fridge an hour ahead of time. It helped to make the salad nicely chilled and helped to combine the flavors. I will probably make again for my hubby with the addition of the cheese.	my mom and dad really liked this but i just thought it was ok . i kept thinking that it needed something like maybe some buffalo mozzeralla cut into cubes but both of my parents thought it was great as it was . we used 1 cup of chicken from a rotisserie chicken . i mixed the veggies with the dressing and put it in the fridge for an hour or so before we were ready to serve . i also cooked the pasta dra ined it and put it in the fridge an hour ahead of time . it helped to make the salad nicely chilled and helped to combine the flavors . i will probably make again for my hubby with the addition of the c heese .	1

This salad is delicious! I served it to my husband and brother and they both loved it. I did change a little bit of it though.

I've made this several times, the first time following the directions exactly, but the bacon was undercooked and left the chicken very greasy.  The next time I pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave about half way first, but again, the chicken was a bit greasy and the bacon wasn't doing anything to compliment the chicken.  Now instead of bacon I wrap the chicken in prescutto and it's perfect!  The flavors mix very well with the feta and spinach stuffing.  It's now the first thing I cook for a guy when I want to impress him, and it works like a charm!  	i 've made this several times , the first time following the directions exactly , but the bacon was undercooked and left the chicken very greasy . the next time i pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave ab out half way first , but again , the chicken was a bit greasy and the bacon was n't doing anything to compliment the chicken . now instead of bacon i wrap the chicken in prescutto and it 's perfect ! the flavors mix very well with the feta and spinach stuffing . it 's now the first thing i cook for a guy when i want to impress him , and it works like a charm !	1
I too added a few of my own touches.  I skipped the bacon, brushing olive oil on top of the chicken instead.

This recipe as is I would not have enjoyed however I took the basis and added my own ingredients.  I first used monteray jack instead of feta because I don't like it.  Then to the spinach mix I added chopped onion and mushroom as well as chopped bacon instead of wrapping the chicken in bacon. Once the chicken was cooked I topped it with a bernaise sauce.  It was very rich and flavorful.

Wow - now this is a salad! It's full of vibrant colors and it's a great combination of flavors. I can see why the submitter gets rave reviews when it's served. I know I certainly did! And I'm glad I read through the reviews because I cut the sugar in half and that was plenty. I also opted for olive oil vs. veg. oil and dijon vs. dry mustard. You can definitely play with this to suite your tastes and you won't be disapppointed. I added some dried cranberries to the mix for that little extra something...

DELICIOUS!!! I am rating the dressing portion of this recipe only although I'm sure the salad with this dressing on it would still be five stars! I made half the recipe of dressing cutting the sugar back to 1/4 cup as other reviewers suggested and I used about 1 T. of finely minced sweet onion instead of the red onion. I had an apple that had been hanging around way too long and a few dried cranberries left in the bag so I added those to red leaf lettuce chopped green onion and toasted almonds for a marvelous salad that hubby and I both really liked. I'll be making this dressing again for sure!! Here's a little tip that I've used many times since I like to do as much ahead of time as possible. Chop apple and toss in a little of the dressing making sure to coat well then refrigerate until ready to toss the salad. This keeps the apples from turning brown - works like a charm!	delicious !!! i am rating the dressing portion of this recipe only although i 'm sure the salad with this dressing on it would still be five stars ! i made half the recipe of dressing cutting the sugar b ack to 1/4 cup as other reviewers suggested and i used about 1 t. of finely minced sweet onion instead of the red onion . i had an apple that had been hanging around way too long and a few dried cranbe rries left in the bag so i added those to red leaf lettuce chopped green onion and toasted almonds for a marvelous salad that hubby and i both really liked . i 'll be making this dressing again for sure !! here 's a little tip that i 've used many times since i like to do as much ahead of time as possible . chop apple and toss in a little of the dressing making sure to coat well then refrigerate until r eady to toss the salad . this keeps the apples from turning brown - works like a charm !	1
Excellent Salad! Very refreshing and a great addition to our Father's Day menu this year. Followed the recipe with the exception of using a couple of small shallots diced very small in place of the red onion. I don't care for a strong onion flavor so I didn't add them to the blender with the other ingredients. I stirred them into the finished dressing right before service. Worked great. We would be very happy to make this again.

I was pretty disappointed considering everyone gave this recipe 5 stars. I thought the dressing was entirely too onion-y and the salad lacked flavor.

Calling all avocado lovers! This particular recipe was extremely quick and easy. Very smooth and creamy! This is a great alternative to using mayo in my chicken salad all of the time. The sour cream adds just the right amount of acidity along with the lime. This recipe did call for blending the chicken with the avocado but I did see the review mentioning that it came out pasty. I have made it with the chicken blended and while I do not mind it I really enjoy chunks of chicken in my salad so I opted this time to add it after I have blended all of the other ingredients. I served it along with some brioche sliders and voila! Perfect for a group of friends too. Will continue to make this again and again!	calling all avocado lovers ! this particular recipe was extremely quick and easy . very smooth and creamy ! this is a great alternative to using mayo in my chicken salad all of the time . the sour cream a dds just the right amount of acidity along with the lime . this recipe did call for blending the chicken with the avocado but i did see the review mentioning that it came out pasty . i have made it with the chicken blended and while i do not mind it i really enjoy chunks of chicken in my salad so i opted this time to add it after i have blended all of the other ingredients . i served it along with so me brioche sliders and voila ! perfect for a group of friends too . will continue to make this again and again !	1

I made this and loved it! The only changes I made were using Greek yogurt instead of sour cream & I used half the amount of pepper (but next time might use even less).

This recipe is delicious! A couple changes- instead of sour cream use 0% milk fat Greek yogurt. Tastes the same has less fat and is loaded with protein.

This is good. I really liked the lime and avocado flavor with the chicken. I didn't add all the pepper--probably just a total of 1/4 t. I used canned chicken so I didn't puree any of it--just stirred it all around until creamy but with a few chunks. I took some out for myself and then I added diced red onion because my husband has to have raw onion in any chicken salad. I also added a few dashes of hot sauce to his.	this is good . i really liked the lime and avocado flavor with the chicken . i did n't add all the pepper -- probably just a total of 1/4 t. i used canned chicken so i did n't puree any of it -- just stirred it all around until creamy but with a few chunks . i took some out for myself and then i added diced red onion because my husband has to have raw onion in any chicken salad . i also added a few dashes o f hot sauce to his .	1
I loved this recipe (with some additions from the comments) - I reduced the oil, increased the juice, used rice wine vinegar, added the garlic and ginger and some sugar for the dressing - ABSOLUTELY necessary additions or else you're basically just pouring juice on your salad. - I also included red peppers in the salad and it was a HUGE hit.	i loved this recipe -lrb- with some additions from the comments -rrb- - i reduced the oil , increased the juice , used rice wine vinegar , added the garlic and ginger and some sugar for the dressing - absolutely n ecessary additions or else you 're basically just pouring juice on your salad . - i also included red peppers in the salad and it was a huge hit .	2
I made this recipe for my gourmet group in which I was doing a Luau theme. Everyone loved it. I made several changes though. I increased the pineapple juice to 1/2 cup and used extra (fresh only!!!) cutup pineapple on each individual plate. For presentation I also used some star fruit on each plate (looks pretty and adds more color). Also I decreased the onion to 2 and upped the coconut to 1/2 cup. I really wanted to bring out the tropical flavors of this recipe. I would definitely make this recipe again!	i made this recipe for my gourmet group in which i was doing a luau theme . everyone loved it . i made several changes though . i increased the pineapple juice to 1/2 cup and used extra -lrb- fresh only !!! -rrb- c utup pineapple on each individual plate . for presentation i also used some star fruit on each plate -lrb- looks pretty and adds more color -rrb- . also i decreased the onion to 2 and upped the coconut to 1/2 cup . i really wanted to bring out the tropical flavors of this recipe . i would definitely make this recipe again !	1
Great salad! Such a delicious combination. I used ready-made real bacon bits and they worked fine. Upped the amount of pineapple juice because I wanted more of that flavor. Also used canned pineapple tidbits. By using the canned pineapple and precooked bacon I saved a ton of time. Also used macadamia nuts (they were salted so I rinsed them off because toasting. My daughter liked it as well even though she doesn't like coconut. I have made tons of salads using various fruits but never have dabbled with pineapple in this kind of combination. This is my new favorite and I am going to say the best salad I have ever had in my life.	great salad ! such a delicious combination . i used ready-made real bacon bits and they worked fine . upped the amount of pineapple juice because i wanted more of that flavor . also used canned pineapple tidbits . by using the canned pineapple and precooked bacon i saved a ton of time . also used macadamia nuts -lrb- they were salted so i rinsed them off because toasting . my daughter liked it as well even th ough she does n't like coconut . i have made tons of salads using various fruits but never have dabbled with pineapple in this kind of combination . this is my new favorite and i am going to say the best salad i have ever had in my life .	1
What a great salad! We loved it even kids and will make again. I omitted the bacon (didn't have any) increased the pineapple juice to 1/2 cup as suggested and had to use the sugar-coated almonds rather than the macadamias. The toasted coconut is so good on this salad! Thanks Marianne!

This was a really tastey light and easy salad to make. I'm always looking for more salad recipes that encorporate fruit and greens. Everyone liked it. I had some butter lettuce and baby spinach on hand so I mixed that in with the romaine lettuce and it made for a nice salad mix. Makes a bit too much dressing for the size of the salad but there was absolutely nothing wrong with the taste! It will be something I make again.	this was a really tastey light and easy salad to make . i 'm always looking for more salad recipes that encorporate fruit and greens . everyone liked it . i had some butter lettuce and baby spinach on han d so i mixed that in with the romaine lettuce and it made for a nice salad mix . makes a bit too much dressing for the size of the salad but there was absolutely nothing wrong with the taste ! it will b e something i make again .	1

Oh my goodness were we pleasantly surprised and rewarded on this! It looked just beautiful on the red leaf lettuce and the taste matched its presentation. The combination of creamy sour cream buttery smooth avocado and smoky bacon was just out of this world. Whether eaten on its own as a salad or served in tacos you will not be disappointed. This will be my new guacamole and because of this recipe we will be eating a lot more avocados.

I'm originally from the Tampa Bay area and I grew up with avocado and key lime trees in my yard so I grew up with fresh guacamole in the wintertime or what passes for winter in Florida. When it comes to regular guacamole less ingredients are better but the avocados must be very ripe or it will lack flavor and creamy consistency. This salad is excellent but especially good if your avocados are a touch underripe for standard guacamole. I added a clove of garlic and substituted key lime juice for lemon. Key lime is tarter than regular lime and gives it a unique flavor. I would even suggest regular Persian lime instead of lemon in this recipe. Overall excellent as a dip or even condiment to tacos or fajitas.	i 'm originally from the tampa bay area and i grew up with avocado and key lime trees in my yard so i grew up with fresh guacamole in the wintertime or what passes for winter in florida . when it comes to regular guacamole less ingredients are better but the avocados must be very ripe or it will lack flavor and creamy consistency . this salad is excellent but especially good if your avocados are a to uch underripe for standard guacamole . i added a clove of garlic and substituted key lime juice for lemon . key lime is tarter than regular lime and gives it a unique flavor . i would even suggest regula r persian lime instead of lemon in this recipe . overall excellent as a dip or even condiment to tacos or fajitas .	1

This is VERY close to a recipe I used to make and have been searching for-- with the following changes:  1) instead of cooking fresh onion, dried chopped onion can be substituted (the liquids in the dish will reconstitue it,)  2) instead of cream of mush, use cream of celery soup, 3) lose all that salt and just use a little garlic powder, plus a dash or two of worcestershire instead of the lemon juice, and, 4) top with crushed cheez-its instead of Ritz-- the extra cheddar crunch gives the entire dish a great zing  (go crazy-- tabasco cheez-its are expecially good.)  No need to top with butter, the topping will brown nicely enough.  You can adjust the fat content by eliminating the butter and using low-fat soup.  I also use the canola Hellman's with no cholesterol.  Ditching the salt brings the sodium content down to next-to-nothing, even with the modicum of worcestershire. When all is said and done, what you're really making here is a custard-- that's why you mix the soup, eggs, and mayo together and then fold in the broccoli and the cheese.  It should never be runny.  The entire casserole can be assembled the day before and refrigerated, then the topping added right before cooking. Enjoy!	this is very close to a recipe i used to make and have been searching for -- with the following changes : 1 -rrb- instead of cooking fresh onion , dried chopped onion can be substituted -lrb- the liquids in the d ish will reconstitue it , -rrb- 2 -rrb- instead of cream of mush , use cream of celery soup , 3 -rrb- lose all that salt and just use a little garlic powder , plus a dash or two of worcestershire instead of the lemon j uice , and , 4 -rrb- top with crushed cheez-its instead of ritz -- the extra cheddar crunch gives the entire dish a great zing -lrb- go crazy -- tabasco cheez-its are expecially good . -rrb- no need to top with butter , the topping will brown nicely enough . you can adjust the fat content by eliminating the butter and using low-fat soup . i also use the canola hellman 's with no cholesterol . ditching the salt brings the sodium content down to next-to-nothing , even with the modicum of worcestershire . when all is said and done , what you 're really making here is a custard -- that 's why you mix the soup , eggs , and ma yo together and then fold in the broccoli and the cheese . it should never be runny . the entire casserole can be assembled the day before and refrigerated , then the topping added right before cooking . enjoy !	2
This is my all time favorite comfort food! The only changes I made, were to use Egg Beaters, reduced fat cheddar cheese, reduced fat or fat free mayo, reduced fat Ritz and fat free cream of mushroom soup.  Since this is such a flavorful recipe, you really cannot tell the difference at all.  We did a side by side taste comparison – no difference.  Too much time on our hands I guess, but we saved a bunch of fat and calories!	this is my all time favorite comfort food ! the only changes i made , were to use egg beaters , reduced fat cheddar cheese , reduced fat or fat free mayo , reduced fat ritz and fat free cream of mushroom s oup . since this is such a flavorful recipe , you really can not tell the difference at all . we did a side by side taste comparison -- no difference . too much time on our hands i guess , but we saved a bunch of fat and calories !	1

Thanks for trying my recipe and I'm glad you all liked it so much! The only difference between this and Succotash is the addition of green lima beans. Also I noticed that some of the changes they made to my wording when the edited my recipe made it more difficult to understand. The Thyme is optional and the Thyme and Parsley should be finely chopped not minced. Also to cook and stir is to saute. I've used sweet corn or shoepeg corn for this recipe and it's wonderful either way. You can also substitute chicken broth for the beef broth and add a little sage or substitute seafood broth and add schrimp for some different flavors.

This is one delicious side dish. I used yellow and white corn more creole seasoning spicy salt in place of the salt and cayene. Oh and about four rashers of thick cut pepper bacon (more YUM!). I also used about a cup or so of beef broth and let it simmer down and absorb all of that flavor. Highly recommended thanks so much for sharing this.

I do NOT recommend that you make this for a party or gathering of some kind. When you are done preparing it you have to taste it to ensure it is worthy of putting your name on (like any good chef would). One taste bite leads to a second third next thing you know you have polished off more than half of it. I stuck to the recipe and it is fantastic. My wife HATES peas. I mean won't eat them if they are the only thing left between her and starvation. So I gave her a blind taste test and even she LOVED it.	i do not recommend that you make this for a party or gathering of some kind . when you are done preparing it you have to taste it to ensure it is worthy of putting your name on -lrb- like any good chef woul d -rrb- . one taste bite leads to a second third next thing you know you have polished off more than half of it . i stuck to the recipe and it is fantastic . my wife hates peas . i mean wo n't eat them if they are the only thing left between her and starvation . so i gave her a blind taste test and even she loved it .	1

I made the recipe as written except I used regular raisins as that's what I had on hand and omitted the bacon but sprinkled bacon bits on top. I think it would be better if the sunflower seeds and cheese were at least doubled. Slivered or sliced almonds could be used instead of the sunflower seeds--would add a little more crunch plus visual interest. Chow mein noodles could also be sprinkled across the top for extra crunch.	i made the recipe as written except i used regular raisins as that 's what i had on hand and omitted the bacon but sprinkled bacon bits on top . i think it would be better if the sunflower seeds and che ese were at least doubled . slivered or sliced almonds could be used instead of the sunflower seeds -- would add a little more crunch plus visual interest . chow mein noodles could also be sprinkled acros s the top for extra crunch .	1
I thought this was fantastic!  I live in New Orleans and believe the taste to be authentic.  Due to previous reviews about it being too runny, I drained the tomatoes (I used diced tomatoes with onion, celery, and green peppers).  I omitted the pepper (my family doesn't like them), and added 4 or so cloves of sliced garlic (a must!).  I used Tony Chachere's seasoning, and only 1/2 tsp. cayenne and I thought it was perfect, but some (like my mother-in-law who is very sensitive), might find it a big spicy (nothing a little sour cream on top won't fix :D).  Finally, I planned on adding rice directly in the crock pot, but it turned out to actually be too dry (may be because it cooked for 9 1/2 hours), so I had to cook the rice separately, then stirred it in with about 1/2 cup of extra chicken broth.

"I have never been a real jambalaya fan...but this is the BOMB!  I love the combination of chicken, sausage and shrimp.  The only things I do different... I don't like cooked celery, so I omit that...and I serve it over red beans a rice that I make from a package, instead of plain white rice.  Oh I also use uncooked shrimp and add it a little earlier to the crock pot...cooked shrimp tends to get too chewy.

My whole family loved this recipe. I would not cut down on the spices like some suggested. I don't like things too spicy and this had kick but was not too hot. I also would make the rice separate and pour the jambalaya over it. I tried adding the rice to the crock pot and it absorbed all of the liquid too quickly not allowing the rice to fully cook.	my whole family loved this recipe . i would not cut down on the spices like some suggested . i do n't like things too spicy and this had kick but was not too hot . i also would make the rice separate and pour the jambalaya over it . i tried adding the rice to the crock pot and it absorbed all of the liquid too quickly not allowing the rice to fully cook .	1

I used a combination of red, orange and yellow organic peppers and I threw in a bunch of fresh minced garlic and three coarsely chopped zucchini in with the chopped veggies/chicken. Instead of kidney beans, I used organic black beans because that's what I had on hand.

I was not at all impressed with this chili. To me it tasted like it was definitely missing something and I could not figure out what it was. This soup was watery and the chicken didn't soak up the flavor well at all. It was extremely bland. I eventually added some hot sauce oregano and cheese which seemed to help some.

The genius of this recipe is the first step - roasting ribs in the oven. This removes fat and liquid that would otherwise cause soupy results in the crockpot. For this, it deserves 5 stars!! Use any sauce (I like 1 C. ketchup, 1 C. Stubb's barbecue sauce, 2 T. brown sugar, 1 t. Worcestershire, and Tabasco hot sauce to taste.) The original sauce recipe (which I've tried) isn't sharp or hot enough for our tastes. We use boneless beef chuck country ribs, 2 lbs. or more. Stir once during cooking time so ribs don't stick to sides and burn. To thicken sauce a bit, put the crockpot on High, with the lid ajar, during the last half hour.

OH MY GOSH--these were the most incredible ribs I have ever tasted in or out of a restaraunt! I followed other reviewers' advice and substituted bbq sauce for the ketchup (2 cups) and ketchup for the chili sauce.

This rib recipe convinced my dinner guest that he needs a slow cooker! I substituted the 2 cup equivalent of my favorite BBQ sauce for the ketchup and they were delicious. I would also recommend rotating the ribs halfway through the cooking process if possible so that all the ribs are equally tender. This just became my favorite slow cooker recipe.	this rib recipe convinced my dinner guest that he needs a slow cooker ! i substituted the 2 cup equivalent of my favorite bbq sauce for the ketchup and they were delicious . i would also recommend rotat ing the ribs halfway through the cooking process if possible so that all the ribs are equally tender . this just became my favorite slow cooker recipe .	1
This was soooooo good. I substitued half of the ketchup with BBQ sauce and used red wine vinegar and it came out better than ribs at some of the restaurants. My husband is a great ribs fan so will definitely make this again.	this was soooooo good . i substitued half of the ketchup with bbq sauce and used red wine vinegar and it came out better than ribs at some of the restaurants . my husband is a great ribs fan so will def initely make this again .	1
This recipe is great!!! The meat was sooo tender and the sauce was tasty with a good kick but not overwhelmingly spicy. I wouldn't change a thing except up the chili sauce and hot sauce if you're a fan of more heat. And just a note to several of the other reviewers... If you just dumped a bottle of barbeque sauce into the slow cooker instead of following the recipe to at least some degree you really have no reason to write a review. Trust me this sauce tastes nothing like KC Masterpiece all you really did was look at this to find out how long to cook them. Why waste our time with a completely unhelpful review?	this recipe is great !!! the meat was sooo tender and the sauce was tasty with a good kick but not overwhelmingly spicy . i would n't change a thing except up the chili sauce and hot sauce if you 're a fa n of more heat . and just a note to several of the other reviewers ... if you just dumped a bottle of barbeque sauce into the slow cooker instead of following the recipe to at least some degree you real ly have no reason to write a review . trust me this sauce tastes nothing like kc masterpiece all you really did was look at this to find out how long to cook them . why waste our time with a completely unhelpful review ?	1
What an excellent breakfast this made! I toasted a slice of baguette in the pan that I cooked the Prosciutto in which was a great addition. My asparagus wasn't very thick so it only took about 10 total to roast. Thanks for another great recipe Chef John.	what an excellent breakfast this made ! i toasted a slice of baguette in the pan that i cooked the prosciutto in which was a great addition . my asparagus was n't very thick so it only took about 10 tota l to roast . thanks for another great recipe chef john .	1
Just finished this dish and loved it. Minor changes - used bacon since that's all I had on hand and didn't use any oil just a little bacon fat w/the bacon pieces and salt and pepper on the asparagus. As someone else mentioned - great low carb dish and healthy (if you don't use too much bacon;). Next time I might try some grated Parmesan on top.	just finished this dish and loved it . minor changes - used bacon since that 's all i had on hand and did n't use any oil just a little bacon fat w/the bacon pieces and salt and pepper on the asparagus . as someone else mentioned - great low carb dish and healthy -lrb- if you do n't use too much bacon ;-rrb- . next time i might try some grated parmesan on top .	1

This was incredible! Hubs made it as one of the 2 meals he cooks every week. I was amazed at how filling a few shoots of asparagus and an egg was. And the lemon zest pushed it right over the top.

What an underrated recipe! This was the best asparagus recipe I have ever had the pleasure of making and eating. The egg part was a bit tricky to make but on the second try it came out perfect just be patient with that part if its your first time cooking your egg in such a way.

I could eat this any time of day breakfast lunch or dinner. Made it twice in the past week; so good especially with all the fresh spring asparagus around. It's just so simple and elegant. I've had asparagus with proscuitto and asparagus with lemon and asparagus with egg (not poached) but never all together. Very creative and easy recipe that turns my favorite vegetable into a substantial and delicious meal. Thanks again Chef John another great recipe.

This is almost identical to a recipe that I love.  The only difference is that in my recipe you add 1/3 of a cup of chicken broth with the lemon juice to the pan drippings.  This helps to add the needed liquid for the sauce.

I will make this easy recipe again but with some changes. I loved the spice mixture but it wasn't enough to adequately cover/rub four breasts so I had make another batch. Also, way, way, WAY too much garlic powder at the end. It overpowered the other flavors, especially the lime.  I will reduce the amount of garlic powder and double the other ingredients in the future.	i will make this easy recipe again but with some changes . i loved the spice mixture but it was n't enough to adequately cover/rub four breasts so i had make another batch . also , way , way , way too much garlic powder at the end . it overpowered the other flavors , especially the lime . i will reduce the amount of garlic powder and double the other ingredients in the future .	1
This was good but needed some help. First of all do cut chicken breasts into pieces & pound thin. Second don't double the lime juice unless you want it sour. Use 3 TBLSP first (juice of one small lime) and then taste-test the sauce then adjust as needed. The sauce also could benefit from a little chicken broth added when you put in the lime juice.	this was good but needed some help . first of all do cut chicken breasts into pieces & pound thin . second do n't double the lime juice unless you want it sour . use 3 tblsp first -lrb- juice of one small lime -rrb- and then taste-test the sauce then adjust as needed . the sauce also could benefit from a little chicken broth added when you put in the lime juice .	1
This recipe just replaced my old Lime Chicken recipe.  It was wonderful!  So simple and easy, too.  I fixed the marinade in the morning, bumped up the heat-factor a little, used fresh cilantro from my garden (made all the difference) and threw it in a bag along with the juice of a couple limes.  I marinated it all afternoon and then threw it on the grill.  While grilling, I coated it with coarse ground pepper and squeezed fresh lime juice on each side.  Definitly a keeper!  My husband was disappointed he was travelling the next day and couldn't take the leftovers for lunch.  Instead, I sliced up the cold chicken and served it on a salad.  MMMMMMmmmmmm-good!

I'm scratching my head over the glowing reviews. To my palate garlic powder tastes nothing at all like garlic! To me, the flavor is plain nasty. I can't understand why anyone would use a  fake-tasting product when the real thing is both inexpensive and readily available. If you want to make this dish worlds better, mash 3-4 garlic cloves to a paste. Apply to the chicken with the spices. For the sauce, mash another clove or two of garlic (or to taste) and replace that awful powder. Infinitely superior, fresh, and tasty. Try it this way - you won't believe the difference!	i 'm scratching my head over the glowing reviews . to my palate garlic powder tastes nothing at all like garlic ! to me , the flavor is plain nasty . i ca n't understand why anyone would use a fake-tasting product when the real thing is both inexpensive and readily available . if you want to make this dish worlds better , mash 3 - 4 garlic cloves to a paste . apply to the chicken with the spices . for the sa uce , mash another clove or two of garlic -lrb- or to taste -rrb- and replace that awful powder . infinitely superior , fresh , and tasty . try it this way - you wo n't believe the difference !	1
We liked this recipe. I did cut back on the butter (used half the recommended) but followed everything else in recipe. I think next time I will saute the garlic in the butter a bit before adding the remaining ingredients for the sauce. Also I will allow the sauce contents to boil for a couple of minutes to allow the sauce to thicken a bit so that it will stick to the broccoli a bit better. Overall good recipe...I'll be making this again.	we liked this recipe . i did cut back on the butter -lrb- used half the recommended -rrb- but followed everything else in recipe . i think next time i will saute the garlic in the butter a bit before adding the r emaining ingredients for the sauce . also i will allow the sauce contents to boil for a couple of minutes to allow the sauce to thicken a bit so that it will stick to the broccoli a bit better . overall good recipe ... i 'll be making this again .	1
Just made this for the first time and I will absolutely make it again! I only used about 3 tablespoons of butter insead of the full 5 and didn't seem to miss anything. This was so tasty and goes great with a light fish. I made the sauce and tossed the broccoli in it before serving instead of just pouring it over. We loved it to the last little floret!	just made this for the first time and i will absolutely make it again ! i only used about 3 tablespoons of butter insead of the full 5 and did n't seem to miss anything . this was so tasty and goes great with a light fish . i made the sauce and tossed the broccoli in it before serving instead of just pouring it over . we loved it to the last little floret !	1
This broccoli is sooo good. I made it twice already for a family get together and a party at work and everyone loved it. I had so many people ask for the recipe. The only change I made was adding 1 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.	this broccoli is sooo good . i made it twice already for a family get together and a party at work and everyone loved it . i had so many people ask for the recipe . the only change i made was adding 1 tb sp of cornstarch to thicken the sauce .	1
This was the highlight of the dinner I made tonight. I was surprised when we all ignored our chicken in order to eat more broccoli. I used half broccoli and half sliced onions which was very good over rice. I think I'll add some more vegetables next time-- bell pepper celery maybe carrots or water chestnuts-- and serve it over rice as a vegetarian stir-fry. Thanks so much for the recipe. It's excellent!

Very tasty. I followed this recipe to the letter. It’s way too soft and soggy due to, I would guess, the chicken stock. The last time I made it I found a similar recipe that lacks the balsamic vinegar, and chicken stock. Everything else was  basically the same. That recipe was much better and the leftovers were still tasty.	very tasty . i followed this recipe to the letter . it 's way too soft and soggy due to , i would guess , the chicken stock . the last time i made it i found a similar recipe that lacks the balsamic vinegar , and chicken stock . everything else was basically the same . that recipe was much better and the leftovers were still tasty .	1

Made it as written and it was very good.  But I felt that it could do with less bacon/drippings and would still be good.  The method of preparations was simple.  I think that next time, and there will be a next time,  that I would  reduce the amount of the bacon/drippings and the butter.  With all the fat that's in this recipe, it turns a very healthy side dish into one that's high in calories and fats.	made it as written and it was very good . but i felt that it could do with less bacon/drippings and would still be good . the method of preparations was simple . i think that next time , and there will be a next time , that i would reduce the amount of the bacon/drippings and the butter . with all the fat that 's in this recipe , it turns a very healthy side dish into one that 's high in calories and fats .	1

Oh My Goodness...made these this evening. Shaved them with my ceramic slicer and nothing could be easier. Used olive oil and butter then tossed in some REAL bacon bits at the end...Let them sit in the pan long enough to get a bit of brown/caramalized and they were delicious and nutty...even the teenaged boys who turned up their noses dove back for seconds.

I have been making a similar recipe for years and it has been a hit with even the non-brussel sprout lovers. I make it with a few differences.....instead of almonds I use pine nuts. this is a very nice taste saute until lightly toasted and use seasoning salt.

I agree that this recipe is a great crowd pleaser but 4 pounds of Brussels sprouts is WAY too much. I used half that amount with the same amount of the other ingredients and it worked perfectly. I served it for 8 people and we had plenty of leftovers which reheated surprisingly well.	i agree that this recipe is a great crowd pleaser but 4 pounds of brussels sprouts is way too much . i used half that amount with the same amount of the other ingredients and it worked perfectly . i ser ved it for 8 people and we had plenty of leftovers which reheated surprisingly well .	1

This was great. We used about 2 lbs or less of sprouts. My husband cut the sprouts up in 1/3's or 1/4's and it still turned out great.

Very good!! My husband and I loved it. I did half the recipe and it was still a HUGE amount... could have fed a family of 6 easily. Make sure you use thick slices of bacon so that you get enough fat to cook with also make sure you slice them thin. I got a little lazy near the end of my slicing and the thick pieces took longer to cook.

Sounded great but was NOT exciting. It made way too much (and we eat large portions of veg) needed to cook A LOT longer than stated and I had to add oil while cooking to help wilt it. It's possible that since I used center cut bacon that was the problem but I will not be making this recipe as written again. I too had to doctor this up to eat it and was left with a big ol' container of leftovers that nobody ate.	sounded great but was not exciting . it made way too much -lrb- and we eat large portions of veg -rrb- needed to cook a lot longer than stated and i had to add oil while cooking to help wilt it . it 's possible th at since i used center cut bacon that was the problem but i will not be making this recipe as written again . i too had to doctor this up to eat it and was left with a big ol' container of leftovers th at nobody ate .	1

Wow. This recipe is a keeper. I followed the recipe to a T and I wasn't disappointed.

Awesome recipe! I didn't have creme fraiche so I used sour cream plus I subsituted buttermilk for the milk. To add alittle thickness to the soup base one can of cream of chicken soup really did the trick. The biscuits were so light and fluffy but still had great texture and flavor.

Excellent!  I followed the recipe for the most part.  I used 2 stalks chopped celery, 2 cans College Inn Chicken Broth, 1 Cup Milk, 1 Cup Heavy Cream.  I also did not puree the broccoli.  I like a chunky soup.  For the roux I melted the butter and removed from heat.  Then I measured the 3 Tbs. flour in a small bowl and added a little bit at a time of the milk/cream mixture and whisked it till smooth.  Then I added it to the melted butter.  Then added that to the soup.  NO LUMPS!  Served with Grated Cheddar Cheese and Warm French Bread.  So good on a Hurricane Wilma night.	excellent ! i followed the recipe for the most part . i used 2 stalks chopped celery , 2 cans college inn chicken broth , 1 cup milk , 1 cup heavy cream . i also did not puree the broccoli . i like a chu nky soup . for the roux i melted the butter and removed from heat . then i measured the 3 tbs . flour in a small bowl and added a little bit at a time of the milk/cream mixture and whisked it till smoo th . then i added it to the melted butter . then added that to the soup . no lumps ! served with grated cheddar cheese and warm french bread . so good on a hurricane wilma night .	1
This soup is wonderful. I made only minor adjustments to suit my tastes. I left out the celery and added fresh garlic more onion and red pepper flakes. I also added a bit of cream cheese when I was blending the soup. I used half milk and half evaporated milk and added a pinch of nutmeg at the end. This is definitely going into the recipe box.

I avoid making reviewing recipes that i have made changes to because i feel that it isn't really the recipe if i do that however that being said the only change i have ever made to this recipe is i a use a bag of frozen chopped brocoli i put the stems in before i puree and the floret bits in after I like my soup a little chunky.	i avoid making reviewing recipes that i have made changes to because i feel that it is n't really the recipe if i do that however that being said the only change i have ever made to this recipe is i a use a bag of frozen chopped brocoli i put the stems in before i puree and the floret bits in after i like my soup a little chunky .	1
I would give it 5 but I made adjustments. I added a clove of garlic to the onion/celery mix. I also added 1 shredded carrot to the broccoli. I used veg. base instead of chicken to make it vegetarian. Also I added sharp cheddar to the milk rue. Much better than using Velveeta. It was very yummy and even my fussy 2 1/2 yr old ate it up!	i would give it 5 but i made adjustments . i added a clove of garlic to the onion/celery mix . i also added 1 shredded carrot to the broccoli . i used veg . base instead of chicken to make it vegetarian . also i added sharp cheddar to the milk rue . much better than using velveeta . it was very yummy and even my fussy 2 1/2 yr old ate it up !	1
Torn about reviews and what I really thought of this recipe. I really didn't care for this recipe at all. Followed it to a T and it was more of an overly gritty texture of broccoli then a creamy soup. And bland. No umph of flavor. As much salt and pepper as I had to use it still was not very flavorful as other cream of broccoli soups that I've had. So sorry it needs something.	torn about reviews and what i really thought of this recipe . i really did n't care for this recipe at all . followed it to a t and it was more of an overly gritty texture of broccoli then a creamy soup . and bland . no umph of flavor . as much salt and pepper as i had to use it still was not very flavorful as other cream of broccoli soups that i 've had . so sorry it needs something .	1
I made this soup and my husband (who is not a really big soup fan) could not get enough of it.  Only difference I made to the recipe was using 1 cup milk and 1 cup cream (since I had it on hand), rather than 2 cups 2%.  Also, I didn't have the full amount of cheddar, so I threw in maybe 1/3 cup slab of veleeta to make up the difference.  But I almost never have velveeta, and would recommend sticking with the cheddar just out of principle's sake.  I used the stock to make the flour thickener rather than the milk/cream (just a preference).  Then I added the milk and cream at the end with the cheese.  It was definitely a delicious and thick soup, just like Panera's.  Yum! Thanks a bunch, gildawen!	i made this soup and my husband -lrb- who is not a really big soup fan -rrb- could not get enough of it . only difference i made to the recipe was using 1 cup milk and 1 cup cream -lrb- since i had it on hand -rrb- , rath er than 2 cups 2 % . also , i did n't have the full amount of cheddar , so i threw in maybe 1/3 cup slab of veleeta to make up the difference . but i almost never have velveeta , and would recommend sticki ng with the cheddar just out of principle 's sake . i used the stock to make the flour thickener rather than the milk/cream -lrb- just a preference -rrb- . then i added the milk and cream at the end with the che ese . it was definitely a delicious and thick soup , just like panera 's . yum ! thanks a bunch , gildawen !	2
This has the potential to be a really great broccoli cheese soup.  As is, it’s just o.k.   To me it tasted like broccoli with cheese sauce.  It was bland and seemed to be lacking something.   I’m thinking it’s the cooking process.  It seems backwards.  Typically, milk products are added last because simmering can cause curdling, especially if simmered for a long period of time.  It works out o.k. for this recipe because it’s so thick from the cheese that you don’t really notice.   What I found odd was that half of the cooking time is dedicated to just simmering the milk with plain stock, absent of any vegetables or seasonings of any kind.  It’s only in the latter stage when you add the vegetables and those are only cooked just long enough until tender.   Onions, celery, and carrots are essential when it comes to adding flavor to any soup broth and it takes time to develop that flavor.  I would suggest adding those 3 ingredients to the chicken broth at the beginning so they have more cook time.  The other change I would make is when to add the milk.  I would start by adding the broth to the flour first and then the milk, but that’s just me.	this has the potential to be a really great broccoli cheese soup . as is , it 's just o.k. to me it tasted like broccoli with cheese sauce . it was bland and seemed to be lacking something . i 'm thin king it 's the cooking process . it seems backwards . typically , milk products are added last because simmering can cause curdling , especially if simmered for a long period of time . it works out o.k. for this recipe because it 's so thick from the cheese that you do n't really notice . what i found odd was that half of the cooking time is dedicated to just simmering the milk with plain stock , absen t of any vegetables or seasonings of any kind . it 's only in the latter stage when you add the vegetables and those are only cooked just long enough until tender . onions , celery , and carrots are ess ential when it comes to adding flavor to any soup broth and it takes time to develop that flavor . i would suggest adding those 3 ingredients to the chicken broth at the beginning so they have more co ok time . the other change i would make is when to add the milk . i would start by adding the broth to the flour first and then the milk , but that 's just me .	1
I hate to leave a 2-star unfavorable review. However to be fair to those who want to try this in the future I want to give my opinion: it was bland and utterly tasteless. I was so disappointed that I didn't care how close it was to Panera's recipe -- I just wanted flavor! I ended up adding a tablespoon of garlic powder and 2 tablespoons of powdered chicken broth base (2 chicken bouillon cubes would work too) and this did the trick! We ended up with a very tasty soup for dinner and I will make this regularly throughout the winter WITH my additions. Good luck!	i hate to leave a 2 star unfavorable review . however to be fair to those who want to try this in the future i want to give my opinion : it was bland and utterly tasteless . i was so disappointed that i did n't care how close it was to panera 's recipe -- i just wanted flavor ! i ended up adding a tablespoon of garlic powder and 2 tablespoons of powdered chicken broth base -lrb- 2 chicken bouillon cubes woul d work too -rrb- and this did the trick ! we ended up with a very tasty soup for dinner and i will make this regularly throughout the winter with my additions . good luck !	1
The family loved this soup. The only changes I made was to thin the roux with chicken broth instead of milk and added the broth instead of milk. Then I added all the veggies and simmered it, then added the milk at the end.

I'm rating it 3 because I have to rate it. But for a suggestion since I've made the Panera copycat before. First is to blend the ingredients, minus the cheese, in a blender. Second, the secret ingredient is a pinch of nutmeg to the final product. And btw making a roux before adding the liquids gives it more depth.	i 'm rating it 3 because i have to rate it . but for a suggestion since i 've made the panera copycat before . first is to blend the ingredients , minus the cheese , in a blender . second , the secret ingredi ent is a pinch of nutmeg to the final product . and btw making a roux before adding the liquids gives it more depth .	1
I had been craving broccoli cheddar soup and went with this one since it looked easy and had great reviews. I left out the carrots and salt by choice and added 3 chicken bouillon cubes. We all enjoyed it very much and I shall make it again.	i had been craving broccoli cheddar soup and went with this one since it looked easy and had great reviews . i left out the carrots and salt by choice and added 3 chicken bouillon cubes . we all enjoyed it very much and i shall make it again .	1
Don't bother with the butter; you don't need it at all. And do NOT--as some other reviewers have suggested--mix up the flour/sugar mixture with the fruit before adding the fruit to the pie shell. The reason you want copious amounts of sugar both on the bottom and on the top of the fruit (rather than mixed amongst it) is that while baking, the bubbling-hot sugar carmelizes in contact with the bottom and top crusts, a process which makes the crusts rather crispy in the final product. If you mix the sugar up with the fruit, you don't get that crispy crust, and the large amount of water in the rhubarb will definitely make the bottom crust sodden. Don't worry: the sugar makes its way through the fruit anyway, so you won't have parts of the pie too sweet and other parts too tart.	do n't bother with the butter ; you do n't need it at all . and do not -- as some other reviewers have suggested -- mix up the flour/sugar mixture with the fruit before adding the fruit to the pie shell . the reason you want copious amounts of sugar both on the bottom and on the top of the fruit -lrb- rather than mixed amongst it -rrb- is that while baking , the bubbling-hot sugar carmelizes in contact with the botto m and top crusts , a process which makes the crusts rather crispy in the final product . if you mix the sugar up with the fruit , you do n't get that crispy crust , and the large amount of water in the rhu barb will definitely make the bottom crust sodden . do n't worry : the sugar makes its way through the fruit anyway , so you wo n't have parts of the pie too sweet and other parts too tart .	2
AMAZING PIE!!!! So simple...so easy! I thought for sure that it would turn out too sweet because it seemed like a lot of sugar. But it was perfect! You still get that tart zip of the rhubarb that I love! I also added some cinnamon to the sugar mixture..just because I love that flavor. Make sure to put some of the sugar mixture on the bottom like the recipe states. This forms a layer under the rhubarb while baking so that the crust doesn't get soggy. My dad said that this pie tastes almost identical to the one his Mom used to make. That alone will make me use this recipe over and over again!

This was fabulous.  I did make some little changes tho--I upped the rhubarb per pie to 6cups (could have done fine with 8 I think), kept sugar at 1 1/3 cup, upped the flour by half for a non-running pie...added 1 tsp cinnamon to the flour/sugar mix, and a few drops of vanilla to the pie all around, before baking..milk and sugar on top before baking made a flaky, crispy top crust--gosh but the kids LOVED THIS, so did the husband...out of vanilla ice cream so used some RediWhip instead.  Did 2 of these today, but next time I'll do 3 or 4 on one day.

Great basic recipe that does the trick for rhubarb lovers! Perfect combination of tart & sweet.  My only suggestion is to brush the top of the pie with one egg mixed with a tbsp water and sprinkle with sugar.  Repeat about halfway through.  Helps keep the crust from browing too fast and gives it a really sweet crispy finish.

make sure you DISCARD all of the leaf portion of the plant!!! The leaves of rhubarb are POISONOUS. Seriously. Just use the stalk portion. Other than that its a fantastic recipe!!	make sure you discard all of the leaf portion of the plant !!! the leaves of rhubarb are poisonous . seriously . just use the stalk portion . other than that its a fantastic recipe !!	1
this was a very good homemade cake recipe.... the only reason i'm giving it 4 stars is b/c the topping didn't turn out the way i thought..it was very oooey gooey and i thought it was supposed to be kinda crispy .... (i baked it exactly as the recipe said, i didn't lower the temp.) SO READ THIS IF YOU ARE MAKING THIS RECIPE.... WHEN YOUR CAKE IS DONE BAKING AND HAS COOLED........IF YOUR TOPPING IS KINDA RUNNY/GOOEY/NOT CRISPY ENUF FOR YOUR LIKING( you can only tell by flipping it out of the pan first) COVER A PAN IN FOIL AND PLACE CAKE ON PAN (topping up) and place cake in oven on BROIL for a few minutes (depending on how crispy you want it) the pineapple will get a little brown also, but it really helped the topping and still tasted delicious!	this was a very good homemade cake recipe ... . the only reason i 'm giving it 4 stars is b/c the topping did n't turn out the way i thought . . it was very oooey gooey and i thought it was supposed to be ki nda crispy ... -lrb- i baked it exactly as the recipe said , i did n't lower the temp . -rrb- so read this if you are making this recipe ... . when your cake is done baking and has cooled ... if your topping is kinda runny/gooey/not crispy enuf for your liking -lrb- you can only tell by flipping it out of the pan first -rrb- cover a pan in foil and place cake on pan -lrb- topping up -rrb- and place cake in oven on broil for a f ew minutes -lrb- depending on how crispy you want it -rrb- the pineapple will get a little brown also , but it really helped the topping and still tasted delicious !	2
This cake is absolutely perfect! My only complaint is my family started cutting away at my beautiful creation before I could take a picture to post. I followed the recipe as is. I did add a little, too. After I put the brown sugar mix in I sprinkled coconut on top and then layered the pineapple and added some maraschino cherries to the design. I made two cakes and after they cooled I stacked them. SIMPLY WONDERFUL -  especially the cake's texture and the way the candied sauce just melts into the cake without making it soggy. Someone said they didn't know what stiff but not dry egg whites meant. When you hit that foamy looking stage turn your mixer up and keep going for another minute or so. The egg whites will leave ripples and look shiny.	this cake is absolutely perfect ! my only complaint is my family started cutting away at my beautiful creation before i could take a picture to post . i followed the recipe as is . i did add a little , to o . after i put the brown sugar mix in i sprinkled coconut on top and then layered the pineapple and added some maraschino cherries to the design . i made two cakes and after they cooled i stacked them . simply wonderful - especially the cake 's texture and the way the candied sauce just melts into the cake without making it soggy . someone said they did n't know what stiff but not dry egg whites meant . when you hit that foamy looking stage turn your mixer up and keep going for another minute or so . the egg whites will leave ripples and look shiny .	1
This cake is very moist and has an excellent presentation.

Had a good flavor, but the cake came out dry. I am not sure what I did, as I followed the recipe precisely. However, maybe I whisked the egg whites too long because it was rather foamy?

Have made this twice now, once with squash, and once with two peeled and chopped yams.  The first time, I accidentally added an extra can of chick peas, and it was so good, I doubled it again the next time! Also added a teaspoon each of cinnamon and cumin.

If you know me at all you know I love to cook. If you don t know me any of my friends will tell you that I m pretty good at it. Last night was no exception if I must say so myself.

I cooked the meat separately this time but I m sure it would be terrific in the pot. It s funny I m not really a big vegetable eater and some of the vegetables in this dish are not very appealing to me but the combination of the vegetables and the spices makes this something special.

Despite the fact that I punched this up with a tablespoon of minced ginger root and about a teaspoon of lemon zest (sauted with the chicken onions and garlic) and added 1 tsp of tumeric 1 tsp of cumin and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon with the spices it still tasted rather bland. The chicken didn't pick up any of the flavors and the garbanzo beans seemed to add texture but no flavor. I think next time I'll put the chicken in a ziploc bag with the garlic onion ginger and lemon zest for a few hours before starting. I did like the butternut squash though. It added just enough sweetness.	despite the fact that i punched this up with a tablespoon of minced ginger root and about a teaspoon of lemon zest -lrb- sauted with the chicken onions and garlic -rrb- and added 1 tsp of tumeric 1 tsp of cumin and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon with the spices it still tasted rather bland . the chicken did n't pick up any of the flavors and the garbanzo beans seemed to add texture but no flavor . i think next time i 'll put the chicken in a ziploc bag with the garlic onion ginger and lemon zest for a few hours before starting . i did like the butternut squash though . it added just enough sweetness .	1

I've made this a few times and think it's great! I've tried it both with the butternut squash, and with sweet potatoes (yams) when I had no squash -- either will work fine. Instead of ground coriander (I don't have any) I use fresh coriander -- cilantro. I chop about 1 1/2T and it gives it a pretty look and great flavor. Last time, I also added 1/2t cumin, as well as 1/4 cup raisins. It has a nice sweet/salty flavor -- would be great with fresh lemon wedges as a garnish, as well. To make it more filling, last time I cooked a couple cups of basmati rice and stirred it in at the last minute... not so soupy, but still a nice consistency, and it goes a bit farther.	i 've made this a few times and think it 's great ! i 've tried it both with the butternut squash , and with sweet potatoes -lrb- yams -rrb- when i had no squash -- either will work fine . instead of ground coriander -lrb- i do n't have any -rrb- i use fresh coriander -- cilantro . i chop about 1 1/2 t and it gives it a pretty look and great flavor . last time , i also added 1/2 t cumin , as well as 1/4 cup raisins . it has a nice sweet/salty flavor -- would be great with fresh lemon wedges as a garnish , as well . to make it more filling , last time i cooked a couple cups of basmati rice and stirred it in at the last minute ... n ot so soupy , but still a nice consistency , and it goes a bit farther .	1

Wonderful scone recipe - I froze the butter and then grated it into the dry ingredients. I added a little more sugar, as I love a sweet scone. I used half and half instead of milk and after the egg wash topped them off with turbinado sugar for that extra added crunch. This is a great base for add-ins like dried cranberries and white or dark chocolate chips. These come out of the oven beautiful... almost look too good to eat!	wonderful scone recipe - i froze the butter and then grated it into the dry ingredients . i added a little more sugar , as i love a sweet scone . i used half and half instead of milk and after the egg wa sh topped them off with turbinado sugar for that extra added crunch . this is a great base for add-ins like dried cranberries and white or dark chocolate chips . these come out of the oven beautiful ... almost look too good to eat !	2

This would be a 5-star recipe if the measurements were accurate. I was hoping for some reader comments but had to figure it out myself. I ended up increasing the amount of flour to about 2 cups and I would have added just a little bit more sugar (not too much since scones shouldn't be overly sweet and it would overpower the natural sweetness of the orange/cranberries I used). With those adjustments though it's a great recipe! Very authentic and delicious! The center is moist but it's got a nice crusty outside. Like other reviewers said it's so versatile! I might try lemon or candied ginger next time.	this would be a 5 star recipe if the measurements were accurate . i was hoping for some reader comments but had to figure it out myself . i ended up increasing the amount of flour to about 2 cups and i would have added just a little bit more sugar -lrb- not too much since scones should n't be overly sweet and it would overpower the natural sweetness of the orange/cranberries i used -rrb- . with those adjustment s though it 's a great recipe ! very authentic and delicious ! the center is moist but it 's got a nice crusty outside . like other reviewers said it 's so versatile ! i might try lemon or candied ginger nex t time .	1

I made these for Valentine's Day and they were a big hit. Nice and moist. The only change I made was with the food coloring. Since I was using a gel food color I knew that a tablespoon would be too much so added it to the batter a little bit at a time until I got the color I wanted. Would definitely make them again.	i made these for valentine 's day and they were a big hit . nice and moist . the only change i made was with the food coloring . since i was using a gel food color i knew that a tablespoon would be too mu ch so added it to the batter a little bit at a time until i got the color i wanted . would definitely make them again .	1

HINT: Use a regular knife to cut these... the serrated blade makes a big mess.	by gads ! this is the very = best = biscotti recipe ! usually i ca n't stand those nasty little bricks but these are delicious ! try these even if you usually do n't like biscotti ... m-m-m-m yummy . hint : use a regular knife to cut these ... the serrated blade makes a big mess .	1
Excellent recipe that won me a baking contest! Soft enough that they can be eaten without being dipped in a drink. Make sure to let the logs cool before slicing them otherwise they will crumble and fall apart. Highly recommended!!!!	excellent recipe that won me a baking contest ! soft enough that they can be eaten without being dipped in a drink . make sure to let the logs cool before slicing them otherwise they will crumble and fa ll apart . highly recommended !!!!	1
These are fantastic! I've made several bathces of these in the past few months. Yes the nuts can be difficult to cut through- I coarsley chop mine. I've also coated one side in white chocolate then drizzled it with milk chocolate- beautiful presentation & tastes great! DO use parchment paper as the recipe calls for or they will stick. Wetting your hands does make shaping the sticky dough very easy. These also freeze beautifully. 5 stars!!	these are fantastic ! i 've made several bathces of these in the past few months . yes the nuts can be difficult to cut through - i coarsley chop mine . i 've also coated one side in white chocolate then dr izzled it with milk chocolate - beautiful presentation & tastes great ! do use parchment paper as the recipe calls for or they will stick . wetting your hands does make shaping the sticky dough very easy . these also freeze beautifully . 5 stars !!	1
these are delicious-I made them with olive oil and the 2nd time I use margerine. I liked them better with margerine - I added more cranberries and dipped in white choc-yummy!

Have to give this a just OK rating as I'm not real excited about the olive oil flavor that sneaks through. Otherwise this is a good biscotti and I agree with the others who have added that hint of orange; I substituted orange extract for the almond.	have to give this a just ok rating as i 'm not real excited about the olive oil flavor that sneaks through . otherwise this is a good biscotti and i agree with the others who have added that hint of ora nge ; i substituted orange extract for the almond .	1
I grated one whole orange and used all the zest as it tends to have a better kick and presentation.  Also instead of orange juice, I squeeze all the juice of the grated orange.  Use 1/3 of the juice mix into the cookie batter (to give a more citrus-y taste) and the rest for the frosting.	i grated one whole orange and used all the zest as it tends to have a better kick and presentation . also instead of orange juice , i squeeze all the juice of the grated orange . use 1/3 of the juice m ix into the cookie batter -lrb- to give a more citrus-y taste -rrb- and the rest for the frosting .	1
VERY good! Chewy. a bit on the sweet side with the glaze I preferred it without it and I REALLY like my sweets! I'd also suggest adding 1/2 cup of flour which would produce a slightly softer less sweet cookie. But over all the taste is great! Definitely made it into the family favorites!	very good ! chewy . a bit on the sweet side with the glaze i preferred it without it and i really like my sweets ! i 'd also suggest adding 1/2 cup of flour which would produce a slightly softer less swee t cookie . but over all the taste is great ! definitely made it into the family favorites !	1
I made these cookies for some friends last night who were surprised to love a cookie didn't have chocolate but rather had fruit in it! The orange topping came out a little runny with 3tbs orange juice so I added a bit more confec. sugar to the mix. The cookies turned out much sweeter than I'd imagined and I'll definately be making these again.	i made these cookies for some friends last night who were surprised to love a cookie did n't have chocolate but rather had fruit in it ! the orange topping came out a little runny with 3 tbs orange juice so i added a bit more confec . sugar to the mix . the cookies turned out much sweeter than i 'd imagined and i 'll definately be making these again .	1
This is my recipe, the temperature is not a mistake in the directions. It is to bake at a slow rate to keep the cake moist. This recipe has been made by tons of friends of mine over and over, not one of them has had a problem with the directions, temperature, or the ingredients.   Check your oven temperature with a thermometer, also use the correct size pan. It all makes a difference!!!  Pyrex pans are freezer to oven...their claim to fame when first on the market...that dates me, I guess. 	this is my recipe , the temperature is not a mistake in the directions . it is to bake at a slow rate to keep the cake moist . this recipe has been made by tons of friends of mine over and over , not one of them has had a problem with the directions , temperature , or the ingredients . check your oven temperature with a thermometer , also use the correct size pan . it all makes a difference !!! pyrex pan s are freezer to oven ... their claim to fame when first on the market ... that dates me , i guess .	1
"I have made this recipe many times and it is wonderful.  Frost with a homemade caramel frosting and it is out of this world.
Frosting:
1/3 cup butter, 1/4 cup milk, 1 cup brown sugar, 2 cups powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla.
Combine butter, milk and brown sugar.  Cook over medium heat for a few minutes after mixture begins to boil.  Beat in powdered sugar and vanilla.

I made four cakes.  One exactly per the recipe (how can you rate a recipe unless you make it exactly as written?), one with less sugar per reviews, one with more blueberries per reviews, and one with less sugar and more blueberries.  I took them to the restaurant where I work for a blind taste test with my coworkers.  The majority picked the original recipe as best, but all were wonderful and disappeared before the end of the night.  Management is thinking about adding this to our menu.

"I'm not one to give a five easily but this recipe was wonderful!  I decreased the white sugar by about a 1/3 cup and added more blueberries (I used frozen about 1 and 1/2 cup).  When I use frozen blueberries I toss them in about 1 tbs of the flour to prevent having a purple batter.

This cake is delicious. I used 1 1/2 sticks butter, 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1 ¾ cups fresh blueberries. Some reviewers mentioned it flattening out.

This made a very moist heavy coffee cake but oh so delicious! I cut back butter to 1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) as suggested by others and cut sugar back to 1 cup. Also dusted pecans with flour before adding to cake. Others said they collapsed cake and this old trick from my grandma works fine for that. I did use 2 cups blueberries and a little more cinnamon than suggested.

I made this with fat free sour cream and substituted SPLENDA for half the amount of sugar. You couldn't tell - it was amazing moist and all my classmates (who I brought it to) LOVED it.

This simply is the best recipe to impress your friends not for the diet conscious. I like its heavy moist texture preferably the next day served cold for me. I'm spreading the word here in Australia!

What a winner! Noticing the recipe called for no fat, I was tempted to add a 1/2 stick of butter and I'm so glad I didn't and stuck to the recipe as written, only adding 1 tsp. of vanilla to the batter. This was SO nice and moist with a perfect amount of rhubarb.  Any more, I fear, might have made this soggy rather than cakey, particularly after the first day. I was afraid of glopping on the cinnamon by shaking it over the topping, so rather than take a chance I mixed maybe 3/4 tsp. of cinnamon in with the topping ingredients. Good call I think! This is simply a great, old fashioned coffee cake - nice balance of rich, moist cake, delicately flavored with rhubarb and topped with a buttery, crackly, streusel. Grandmas always seem to know how to do it best!	what a winner ! noticing the recipe called for no fat , i was tempted to add a 1/2 stick of butter and i 'm so glad i did n't and stuck to the recipe as written , only adding 1 tsp . of vanilla to the batte r . this was so nice and moist with a perfect amount of rhubarb . any more , i fear , might have made this soggy rather than cakey , particularly after the first day . i was afraid of glopping on the cinna mon by shaking it over the topping , so rather than take a chance i mixed maybe 3/4 tsp . of cinnamon in with the topping ingredients . good call i think ! this is simply a great , old fashioned coffee cak e - nice balance of rich , moist cake , delicately flavored with rhubarb and topped with a buttery , crackly , streusel . grandmas always seem to know how to do it best !	1
Very moist and flavorful cake.  I got great reviews.  However, if the topping was suppose to be a crumb topping like a crumb cake, mine did not turn out that way.  More flour would have been needed. I will be using this recipe again in the near future.

This cake is amazing! I followed several other suggestions, and used 4 cups of diced rhubarb, and 1/4 cup brown sugar in the cake and all brown sugar in the topping. I had slightly less than a cup of sour cream, so I made up the rest with some vanilla yogurt. The rhubarb taste is very subtle, even with four cups of fruit. This was yummy as a morning coffee cake; yummy with afternoon tea, and especially terrific served warm with a scoop of strawberry ice cream for dessert! Alas, the cake lasted less than a day!	this cake is amazing ! i followed several other suggestions , and used 4 cups of diced rhubarb , and 1/4 cup brown sugar in the cake and all brown sugar in the topping . i had slightly less than a cup of sour cream , so i made up the rest with some vanilla yogurt . the rhubarb taste is very subtle , even with four cups of fruit . this was yummy as a morning coffee cake ; yummy with afternoon tea , and espec ially terrific served warm with a scoop of strawberry ice cream for dessert ! alas , the cake lasted less than a day !	1

I was initially drawn to this recipe because of the minimal fat. I adapted the recipe a bit to try and make it a little healthier: I used 1/2 the amount of sugar (by using Splenda brown sugar) and used whole wheat flour in both the cake and topping. I added 2 tbsp of egg white as I found the cake batter a little dry. And I also used 2 tbsp of apple sauce instead of the oil for the topping. It was REALLY more like a paste, so I had to put it on top by spreading it out by hand. I also baked them in muffin trays as they're a little more portable, but my rhubarb chunks were a little large, so they tended to collapse a bit. I also added the cinnemon as well as ground cloves and allspice into the topping. But VERY moist and delicious cake! Will DEFINATELY make again and look forward to adapting even more!	i was initially drawn to this recipe because of the minimal fat . i adapted the recipe a bit to try and make it a little healthier : i used 1/2 the amount of sugar -lrb- by using splenda brown sugar -rrb- and use d whole wheat flour in both the cake and topping . i added 2 tbsp of egg white as i found the cake batter a little dry . and i also used 2 tbsp of apple sauce instead of the oil for the topping . it was really more like a paste , so i had to put it on top by spreading it out by hand . i also baked them in muffin trays as they 're a little more portable , but my rhubarb chunks were a little large , so they tended to collapse a bit . i also added the cinnemon as well as ground cloves and allspice into the topping . but very moist and delicious cake ! will definately make again and look forward to adapting even more !	1

I made this for my dad's birthday as his favorite desserts are made with rhubarb. I do think it needed more rhubarb than called for. That was also my first impression when I put it in the pan but I didn't want to alter the recipe and possibly have it turn out wrong. The rhubarb really cooked down to a very thin layer of rhubarb. As a whole it didn't have that strong rhubarb flavor I was looking for. The sour cream on top was just fine though I was not sure I wanted to add it I'm glad I did. I'd probably make this again adding more rhubarb.	i made this for my dad 's birthday as his favorite desserts are made with rhubarb . i do think it needed more rhubarb than called for . that was also my first impression when i put it in the pan but i di d n't want to alter the recipe and possibly have it turn out wrong . the rhubarb really cooked down to a very thin layer of rhubarb . as a whole it did n't have that strong rhubarb flavor i was looking fo r . the sour cream on top was just fine though i was not sure i wanted to add it i 'm glad i did . i 'd probably make this again adding more rhubarb .	1

I love this stuffing! This is the second time I've made this and it turned out awesome. Make sure to use a large stock pot to cook the wild rice in because you end up adding a lot more to the pot later on. For the herbs I used 1 Tbsp. rosemary 2 Tbsp. basil 1 Tbsp. oregano 1 Tbsp. thyme 1/2 Tbsp. marjoram and 1/2 tsp. ground sage. I also added 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper. The great thing is you can adjust the herbs according to your tastes. To cut costs I only used raisins and craisins (skipping the apricots and cherries).

I purchased a long grain and wild rice combination and just cooked it up acocrding to the package directions. I used microwave bacon (I hate bacon grease) and set it aside. I sauteed the onion and celery and added the fruit to the rice while the rice was still a little 'wet'. Added the celery and onion the dry herb mix (basil organo thyme sage) to the rice and fruit and cooked on med-low until everything was cooked through. Added the bacon and parley and mixed until warm. This is an incredible dish.

The instructions for the recipe are not written correctly omitting the broth that is called for in the ingredients list. The uncooked long grain rice do not soften in the time instructed. I think this would be a great recipe if the long grain were pre-cooked and then mixed into the other ingredients. The flavor was good the texture was crunchy. No one would eat it at Thanksgiving.	the instructions for the recipe are not written correctly omitting the broth that is called for in the ingredients list . the uncooked long grain rice do not soften in the time instructed . i think this would be a great recipe if the long grain were pre-cooked and then mixed into the other ingredients . the flavor was good the texture was crunchy . no one would eat it at thanksgiving .	1

Made this last night. It was simple enough but I highly recommend doubling the sauce for your recipe. In my case rather than using 6 breasts for the 4 serving size I used 3 breasts and left the sauce amount as is. There was barely enough for my reduced serving. Anyway the chicken came out beautifully. As other reviewers mentioned it could have used more flavor. I'll make sure to salt and pepper the breasts in the future. In addition the sauce could have used more flavor. I used half broth and half wine for my version. I also added garlic powder but it needed something more. Perhaps a bit of rosemary?? All in all I enjoyed the textures of everything just need to spice it up a bit in the future. My accompaniments were brown rice and asparagus.	made this last night . it was simple enough but i highly recommend doubling the sauce for your recipe . in my case rather than using 6 breasts for the 4 serving size i used 3 breasts and left the sauce amount as is . there was barely enough for my reduced serving . anyway the chicken came out beautifully . as other reviewers mentioned it could have used more flavor . i 'll make sure to salt and pepper th e breasts in the future . in addition the sauce could have used more flavor . i used half broth and half wine for my version . i also added garlic powder but it needed something more . perhaps a bit of ro semary ?? all in all i enjoyed the textures of everything just need to spice it up a bit in the future . my accompaniments were brown rice and asparagus .	1
This was very good. I took the suggestion and instead of putting it in the oven I just cooked it in a skillet.

EXCELLENT!! I am going to recommend this recipe to people. I put some asparagus in with the chicken while it baked and it soaked up the lemon flavor and tasted really good!

I marinated the chicken in lemon juice and olive oil for about an hour before cooking in the skillet as suggested by other reviewers. It turned out wonderful. I also added 1 whole cup of chicken broth which yielded a nice amount of sauce for the chicken.

I made as listed but probably should have trusted my instinct to tweak a bit. We all thought this was missing something. The chicken did turn out nice and moist with a pleasant lemon taste but if I were to make this again I'd definitely add minced garlic and perhaps marinate the chicken ahead of time so that it picks up a bit more flavor.	i made as listed but probably should have trusted my instinct to tweak a bit . we all thought this was missing something . the chicken did turn out nice and moist with a pleasant lemon taste but if i we re to make this again i 'd definitely add minced garlic and perhaps marinate the chicken ahead of time so that it picks up a bit more flavor .	1

Absolutely delicious! I did something a little different. I put 3 chicken breasts at a time in a 1 gallon freezer bag and pounded the breasts so they were more even in thickness. I also dipped the breasts in butter and then breaded it. I used seasoned cornbread stuffing and of course more curry and parmesean. (because we love curry and parmesean) Then I placed the chicken in a dish sprayed with PAM and turned 1/2 way through cooking. It browned up nicely and the breading stayed on. It was a hit! Plus I made it ahead of time and just had to take it out of the fridge and put in the ove. LOVED IT. Thanks for the new recipe.	absolutely delicious ! i did something a little different . i put 3 chicken breasts at a time in a 1 gallon freezer bag and pounded the breasts so they were more even in thickness . i also dipped the bre asts in butter and then breaded it . i used seasoned cornbread stuffing and of course more curry and parmesean . -lrb- because we love curry and parmesean -rrb- then i placed the chicken in a dish sprayed with pa m and turned 1/2 way through cooking . it browned up nicely and the breading stayed on . it was a hit ! plus i made it ahead of time and just had to take it out of the fridge and put in the ove . loved it . thanks for the new recipe .	1
Made this from thawed (still a bit frozen in the middle) chicken breasts which increased the cooking time. The chicken turned out very juicy and delicious. I served this with fresh angel hair pasta and steamed broccoli.

My kids loved this receipe. It was almost like a shake and bake chicken but with extra crunchies. I only used two chicken breasts next time I will use 6 and use a little bit more butter for the coating.	my kids loved this receipe . it was almost like a shake and bake chicken but with extra crunchies . i only used two chicken breasts next time i will use 6 and use a little bit more butter for the coatin g.	1
This was a pleasant-tasting and easy to make recipe. I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs as a substitute for the stuffing and Italian seasoning. In addition I dipped the chicken in Italian dressing prior to dipping it in the breadcrumb mix. I ate it with Creamy Parmesan Risotto which was a good combination.

YEAH BABY! This is awesome!! The combination of the tortilla crispies the marinated grilled chicken and the funky dressing makes this salad a huge hit with my entire family!!

Awesome! I'm a huge fan of the Applebee's version and this is just as satisfying. For the dressing (which I did not double--was enough for me) I also added about a tablespoon of taco seasoning to kick it up a bit. I also burned the crispies so I just crumbled up a few tortilla chips for topping. Like Applebee's I also served it with a dallop of sour cream a dallop of salsa and a dallop of homemade guacamole.

I confess I did not make the salad. I only used the chicken suggestion. I marinated the chicken in the mayo/dressing mixture overnight and broiled it the next day. Wow. Who would have thought mayo and Italian dressing would be so delicious together. I'll definitely make the chicken again and even try the salad.	i confess i did not make the salad . i only used the chicken suggestion . i marinated the chicken in the mayo/dressing mixture overnight and broiled it the next day . wow . who would have thought mayo and italian dressing would be so delicious together . i 'll definitely make the chicken again and even try the salad .	1

This is a five-star recipe for me! I could inhale the dressing! I can hardly wait for my family to try this one! Now I'm sorry I cut the recipe in half! I was glad to see that the author of the recipe doesn't blanch the peas because I would not have either. I forgot to get the parsley so that wasn't included in my version and I did get a little heavy handed on the onions garlic and almonds. My sister who sends me the wild rice from Wisconsin will love this recipe! Thank you very much! EDIT: I tasted this several hours into refrigeration and I think what happened is that the rice soaked up all the lovely dressing. So I made more and added it just before serving it. And now I even have a bit of that left over for another purpose!

Excellent and very flavorful. Only gave it four stars because I modified the recipe. I substituted the Tarragon vinegar w/ white wine vinegar and the safflower oil w/ EVOO as both were hard to find in the store. I also used half the amount of crushed red pepper. This would be a good salad to make at the beginning of the week to eat throughout.	excellent and very flavorful . only gave it four stars because i modified the recipe . i substituted the tarragon vinegar w / white wine vinegar and the safflower oil w / evoo as both were hard to find in the store . i also used half the amount of crushed red pepper . this would be a good salad to make at the beginning of the week to eat throughout .	1

This was good! I used Uncle Ben s Long and Wild Rice and seasoned the chicken well with Montreal Seasoning before sautéing. I did think it needed a little dressing so I used about 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar. Lots of crunch with the almonds celery water chestnuts and chow mein noodles. I added the chow mein noodles as a garnish on each serving. I didn t add sesame oil.	this was good ! i used uncle ben s long and wild rice and seasoned the chicken well with montreal seasoning before sautéing . i did think it needed a little dressing so i used about 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar . lots of crunch with the almonds celery water chestnuts and chow mein noodles . i added the chow mein noodles as a garnish on each serving . i didn t add s esame oil .	1

I enjoyed this but I like unusual/exotic dishes. However the group of ladies I served it to didn't seem to enjoy it nor did they ask for the recipe (which they always do when they like a dish served at our ladies luncheons.) If you like out-of-the-ordinary fare you'll probably enjoy this. The cilantro (must use fresh not dried) really makes this dish!! It needed more salt and I doubled the amount of peas and almonds.	i enjoyed this but i like unusual/exotic dishes . however the group of ladies i served it to did n't seem to enjoy it nor did they ask for the recipe -lrb- which they always do when they like a dish served a t our ladies luncheons . -rrb- if you like out-of-the-ordinary fare you 'll probably enjoy this . the cilantro -lrb- must use fresh not dried -rrb- really makes this dish !! it needed more salt and i doubled the amount of peas and almonds .	1

Good stuff! I made this for a family party... that I later had to skip... so I was left with a double recipe's worth. I am eating it this week for lunch at the office. I am gussying it up for the sake of variety...with (at this point) either horseradish or garlic paste (available at the Indian gorcery; looks a lot like horseradish). My one comment on the original recipe: I'm not sure if the bacon added anything at all except keeping it out of vegetarian hands!	good stuff ! i made this for a family party ... that i later had to skip ... so i was left with a double recipe 's worth . i am eating it this week for lunch at the office . i am gussying it up for the sake of variety ... with -lrb- at this point -rrb- either horseradish or garlic paste -lrb- available at the indian gorcery ; looks a lot like horseradish -rrb- . my one comment on the original recipe : i 'm not sure if the bacon added anything at all except keeping it out of vegetarian hands !	1
This was great. I didn't understand a couple of the reviews that said it was dry. This is very creamy. I had some brown rice left over from another recipe so I had to scale the recipe back to match the amount of rice I had. I left out the almonds but I added chopped waterchestnuts and that gave it a great crunch. I also used turkey bacon to cut back fat a little more. So simple to make.	this was great . i did n't understand a couple of the reviews that said it was dry . this is very creamy . i had some brown rice left over from another recipe so i had to scale the recipe back to match th e amount of rice i had . i left out the almonds but i added chopped waterchestnuts and that gave it a great crunch . i also used turkey bacon to cut back fat a little more . so simple to make .	1

I Thought this recipe was great! My family does not eat pork so I switched the bacon for a can of chickpeas and it was fantastic! You could also swap the sour cream for 'soy cream' substitute and make the dish vegan friendly! we also tried it with wild rice mixed in and it added an extra nutty crunch! we will surely make it again! thank you!	i thought this recipe was great ! my family does not eat pork so i switched the bacon for a can of chickpeas and it was fantastic ! you could also swap the sour cream for ` soy cream ' substitute and make the dish vegan friendly ! we also tried it with wild rice mixed in and it added an extra nutty crunch ! we will surely make it again ! thank you !	1

Yum. Few minor changes due to what was in the kitchen: fat free sour cream instead of low fat canadian bacon instead of traditional and pine nuts in stead of almonds. I also used red pepper flakes instead of a res bell pepper. I had some leftover english cucumber from another salad recipe so I tiossed that in as well. Would be good with some tomatoes in this as well. as well as some broccoli slaw	yum . few minor changes due to what was in the kitchen : fat free sour cream instead of low fat canadian bacon instead of traditional and pine nuts in stead of almonds . i also used red pepper flakes ins tead of a res bell pepper . i had some leftover english cucumber from another salad recipe so i tiossed that in as well . would be good with some tomatoes in this as well . as well as some broccoli slaw	1
I have made this salad about 10 times now for various people and they all love it - even my picky teenagers! The only change I make is to use dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard because I think it tastes much better. Also as someone else said here only half the recommended dressing is needed.

Would make kale slices even smaller and marinate in the lemon for at least an hour beforehand so the citrus can break down the kale better. Cut the dressing in half and still had leftover the 1/2 cup of oil just didn't seem right for 6 cups of greens. Also only used one large apple and cut into smaller bite sized pieces but threw in the whole avocado - as everyone knows they don't keep well once cut open. Substituted smoked salmon for the bacon which was great and used Dijon mustard loved dressing the flavor.	would make kale slices even smaller and marinate in the lemon for at least an hour beforehand so the citrus can break down the kale better . cut the dressing in half and still had leftover the 1/2 cup of oil just did n't seem right for 6 cups of greens . also only used one large apple and cut into smaller bite sized pieces but threw in the whole avocado - as everyone knows they do n't keep well once c ut open . substituted smoked salmon for the bacon which was great and used dijon mustard loved dressing the flavor .	1

Absolute best salad ever just as it is. However I often don't have avocado's so I omit them sometimes and have often times used Swiss Chard instead of Kale. I think it is mainly the dressing and you could add whatever else you wanted for the salad part except of course you would have to keep the lovely smoked bacon in it. I also agree with others on probably not using all the salad dressing. I just mix up a double batch and use what I want and keep it in the frig for the next time. Set it out a little before supper so the olive oil melts and it is ready to go.	absolute best salad ever just as it is . however i often do n't have avocado 's so i omit them sometimes and have often times used swiss chard instead of kale . i think it is mainly the dressing and you c ould add whatever else you wanted for the salad part except of course you would have to keep the lovely smoked bacon in it . i also agree with others on probably not using all the salad dressing . i jus t mix up a double batch and use what i want and keep it in the frig for the next time . set it out a little before supper so the olive oil melts and it is ready to go .	1
Did not use the maple syrup because I did not have any. I used brown sugar instead. But it was a hit nonetheless!

This was yummy!

I know this is definitely healthy but I need something to soften the stiffness (lack of a better word) of the kale. Most kale salads that appeal to me are drizzled with a hot oil to wilt the kale slightly and then sprinkled with a light dusting of finely shredded cheese.	i know this is definitely healthy but i need something to soften the stiffness -lrb- lack of a better word -rrb- of the kale . most kale salads that appeal to me are drizzled with a hot oil to wilt the kale slig htly and then sprinkled with a light dusting of finely shredded cheese .	1
Great recipe! I had two people from India helping me make it and they suggested these changes: more curry (they added about 8 tbls), fresh ground pepper, and use Indian Chili powder not cayenne and increase the amount to about 3 tsp. They said that cayenne is a western spice and Indian chili powder is more authentic. This made it VERY hot. We used the sauce to help spice up another mild curry dish we had.	great recipe ! i had two people from india helping me make it and they suggested these changes : more curry -lrb- they added about 8 tbls -rrb- , fresh ground pepper , and use indian chili powder not cayenne and in crease the amount to about 3 tsp . they said that cayenne is a western spice and indian chili powder is more authentic . this made it very hot . we used the sauce to help spice up another mild curry dish we had .	2
"I used this recipe when I made curry myself for the first time ever. I loved it! Absolutely wonderful. 

Having experimented with the recipe since that first experience, I suggest trying out a different first step. 

In a dry pot pre-heated to a medium heat, first roast the curry powder for a minute or until browned, stirring constantly. Add the paprika and the cinnamon, and ginger stirring constantly. (I do not add the sugar) Then add the garlic, bay leaf, and onions, and drizzle the olive oil over top. You can do this with about 1 1/2- 2tbsp. of olive oil. Continue as per the recipe. 

I found that that extra first step enriches the flavor of the curry powder and makes for a fuller-bodied/ slightly spicier curry.

A very nice Chicken Curry.  I also used 1 tsp. of Garam Masala.  I wish I had left out the lemon and the cayenne because I thought it tasted better before those were added.  I even cut down the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. because my youngest daughter doesn't like it too hot.  I think that next time I will omit the last two ingredients.  	a very nice chicken curry . i also used 1 tsp . of garam masala . i wish i had left out the lemon and the cayenne because i thought it tasted better before those were added . i even cut down the cayenn e to 1/4 tsp . because my youngest daughter does n't like it too hot . i think that next time i will omit the last two ingredients .	1
My first comment is to read through the rest of the reviews before making this dish. The recipe alone is a great starting place but you may want to take some of the suggestions you read to make it just right for you. Not everyone likes the same flavors so you need to tweak it specifically for your taste buds.

Ok I did this a lot differently. First of all you should probably add more pasta if you don't want too much of the sauce. I omitted the mustard. I added 1 cup colby and 1/1/2 cup mozzarella and then salt pepper and italian seasonings. Oh ya and peas. Was a great dish will definately make again. This is a good recipe to keep around just for the fact that you can do so much with it(use it as a base). Maybe add chicken or turkey and/or french cut green beans next time. Maybe top it off with some sliced cherry tomatoes.	ok i did this a lot differently . first of all you should probably add more pasta if you do n't want too much of the sauce . i omitted the mustard . i added 1 cup colby and 1/1/2 cup mozzarella and then s alt pepper and italian seasonings . oh ya and peas . was a great dish will definately make again . this is a good recipe to keep around just for the fact that you can do so much with it -lrb- use it as a base -rrb- . maybe add chicken or turkey and/or french cut green beans next time . maybe top it off with some sliced cherry tomatoes .	1
We had a big ham for Christmas with lots of leftovers to use up. This recipe had all the ingredients that my family loves ham cheese noodles garlic I mean what s not to like? And the added bonus was that I had all the ingredients on hand. Which meant no trip needed to the grocery store! Gotta love that! I followed the recipe exactly as stated and it turned out really yummy! Cheesy gooey and warm on a cold stormy winter night! Served with a big green salad. Will serve with some rolls next time too. My husband s only complaint was that it was a tad salty. So the next time I make this I won t add salt to the pasta water when I cook the noodles and I won t be adding any salt to the recipe. The Parmesan cheese and ham provide more than enough salt for this dish. One added bonus about this recipe is that while the noodles are cooking you can make up the sauce and slice the ham; then while the dish is baking in the oven you have just enough time to clean up the dirty pan from the sauce tidy up the kitchen set the table and toss the salad; then after dinner there s only the casserole dish the dinner plates and utensils to wash up! Nice! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

"I made this and several other pumpkin pie recipes for Thanksgiving this one was declared the favorite. My original feeling about it was that it was a little too sweet but I was voted down. I might cut the white sugar by half next time though. I would also make sure you either have an extra crust or some oven-proof bowls it was way too much filling for even my 9"" deep dish crust. Used this recipe again this year and followed it exactly. Either I didn't do it right last year or my tastes have changed it's delicious! It still makes enough for two pies from each batch but everyone loved them so they disappeared VERY quickly!"	i made this and several other pumpkin pie recipes for thanksgiving this one was declared the favorite . my original feeling about it was that it was a little too sweet but i was voted down . i might cut the white sugar by half next time though . i would also make sure you either have an extra crust or some oven-proof bowls it was way too much filling for even my 9 '' deep dish crust . used this recipe a gain this year and followed it exactly . either i did n't do it right last year or my tastes have changed it 's delicious ! it still makes enough for two pies from each batch but everyone loved them so th ey disappeared very quickly !	1
This pie was amazing. I've been making pies from a can since I was a kid and I had a pumpkin leftover from Halloween and had guests coming over for dinner so I thought what the heck and made the pumpkin puree myself. One thing to keep in mind is that it the filling made with homemade pureed pumpkin is much more watery than a canned pumpkin pie so don't be surprised when you put it into the pie crust. I accidentally spilled a good portion of it out of the shell but that ended up being a good thing since it took awhile to cook. I would suggest making a thinner pie rather than deep-dish with this recipe so that the crust won't burn by the time the filling sets up (took about an hour with filling that was maybe 1 1/2 inches thick) and the filling will rise a bit so it won't be thin in the end. I did have maybe 1/3 of the filling leftover after I filled my crust so I threw it in a loaf pan and baked it separately to make a pumpkin custard. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and drained the puree in a colander lined with coffee filters overnight which yielded at least a cup of water which would have made the pie soggy so I'm glad I did that and would suggest it to another who wants to make this pie from scratch. The end result was the absolute best pumpkin pie that I've ever had. Wasn't difficult but was time-consuming but definitely worth the effort.	this pie was amazing . i 've been making pies from a can since i was a kid and i had a pumpkin leftover from halloween and had guests coming over for dinner so i thought what the heck and made the pumpk in puree myself . one thing to keep in mind is that it the filling made with homemade pureed pumpkin is much more watery than a canned pumpkin pie so do n't be surprised when you put it into the pie cru st. i accidentally spilled a good portion of it out of the shell but that ended up being a good thing since it took awhile to cook . i would suggest making a thinner pie rather than deep-dish with this recipe so that the crust wo n't burn by the time the filling sets up -lrb- took about an hour with filling that was maybe 1 1/2 inches thick -rrb- and the filling will rise a bit so it wo n't be thin in the end . i did have maybe 1/3 of the filling leftover after i filled my crust so i threw it in a loaf pan and baked it separately to make a pumpkin custard . i followed the suggestion of another reviewer and d rained the puree in a colander lined with coffee filters overnight which yielded at least a cup of water which would have made the pie soggy so i 'm glad i did that and would suggest it to another who wants to make this pie from scratch . the end result was the absolute best pumpkin pie that i 've ever had . was n't difficult but was time-consuming but definitely worth the effort .	1
With all the positive reviews I was disappointed with the end product. Used homemade pumpkin puree. Sorry to say it was a waste of time. The pie was edible but NOT as a pumpkin pie. Very little pumpkin taste and too many spices. Filling is very runny (even after I used less liquid.....) however it did thicken up nicely. I have to mention the color: not very inviting. I won't be using this recipe again.	with all the positive reviews i was disappointed with the end product . used homemade pumpkin puree . sorry to say it was a waste of time . the pie was edible but not as a pumpkin pie . very little pumpki n taste and too many spices . filling is very runny -lrb- even after i used less liquid ... -rrb- however it did thicken up nicely . i have to mention the color : not very inviting . i wo n't be using this recipe a gain .	1
So good. I'm obsessed with broccoli and this was perfect -- I could eat it three meals a day. I cut back the ham and cheese to 1c. each per reviews and it seemed to be a good quantity to prevent overfilling. Added a sprinkle of nutmeg to the egg mix and stirred the paprika in instead of sprinkling on top. I put some of the cheese on the bottom some mixed in and some on top.	so good . i 'm obsessed with broccoli and this was perfect -- i could eat it three meals a day . i cut back the ham and cheese to 1 c. each per reviews and it seemed to be a good quantity to prevent overf illing . added a sprinkle of nutmeg to the egg mix and stirred the paprika in instead of sprinkling on top . i put some of the cheese on the bottom some mixed in and some on top .	1

I added mushrooms and a sprinkle of nutmeg and I mixed the cheese into the egg/milk mixture since the chef forgot to add a step for the cheese. However it came out very well--thanks for this recipe.

Couldn't find spinach at the last minute so I substituted mixed spinach and lettuce. Didn't seem to make any difference people LOVED it. It was excellent and I followed the original recipe for the dressing. I really don't like yellow mustard but decided to go ahead with it because of the tang. So glad I did it wasn't too mustardy at all. The only thing I changed was cooking the onions in with the bacon. I will definitely make this again!	could n't find spinach at the last minute so i substituted mixed spinach and lettuce . did n't seem to make any difference people loved it . it was excellent and i followed the original recipe for the dre ssing . i really do n't like yellow mustard but decided to go ahead with it because of the tang . so glad i did it was n't too mustardy at all . the only thing i changed was cooking the onions in with the bacon . i will definitely make this again !	1
Made as written with one exception and that is that I only used 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/3 cup. I only made the change due to personal preference. From past experience I've learned that we like equal ratio of sugar and vinegar. This was excellent! If you are like us and there is only two of you keep your dressing separate an add it to your individual servings to keep the spinach from wilting.

This recipe is a great concept but it always bothers me when any recipe calls for 1 1/2 cups of chopped chicken--it ought to say how much that weighs--that would keep the reproducing of the recipe consistent. Also 6 tablespoons of onions? What am i supposed to do--chop the onions and take a tablespoon measure and measure the onions out 6 times? And raw almonds or any nuts don't ever add much to a dish for me--toast them? and it's all the difference in the world. I compliment the person who put this together because it's a really nice combination of flavors. I added a chopped boiled egg--and used Vidalia onions for a sweeter and not overpowering onion taste.	this recipe is a great concept but it always bothers me when any recipe calls for 1 1/2 cups of chopped chicken -- it ought to say how much that weighs -- that would keep the reproducing of the recipe con sistent . also 6 tablespoons of onions ? what am i supposed to do -- chop the onions and take a tablespoon measure and measure the onions out 6 times ? and raw almonds or any nuts do n't ever add much to a dish for me -- toast them ? and it 's all the difference in the world . i compliment the person who put this together because it 's a really nice combination of flavors . i added a chopped boiled egg -- and us ed vidalia onions for a sweeter and not overpowering onion taste .	1
some time. If I'm out of dried cranberries cut in half grapes work well. Like another mentioned I add red onion and cracked pepper to the mix. I'm a fan of cucumber so it's not uncommon for me to add in a diced handful. Radishes are also an excellent addition. Served over a bed of lettuce without the pasta as a sandwich ( I love this stuffed into a pita) or mounded on crackers ( Triscuit is a fantastic choice for this) this always hits the spot on a hot summer day when ease a light fare and coolness are just whats needed.

I made this recipe with a bit of a twist using bowtie pasta and bottled poppy seed dressing. I also deleted the cucumbers because I do not care for them in salads. The onion and green pepper provided just enough flavor with the creamy poppy seed dressing. It was fantastic and my husband loved it!

I give this recipe high marks for its simplicity and flavor. The ingredients are ones I'm likely to have on-hand in the pantry or deep-freeze. It is good as a side in a buffet-style luncheon or handy to-go lunch in a pita pocket. It is a nice break from tuna or chicken salad.

This is a super easy to throw together salad. Per personal preference I'll probably cut the mayo w/sour cream if I make this again because I'm not a big fan of mayo.

This is such a fantastic recipe! I often bulk it out a bit by using more onion a couple of different colored peppers etc; adding a can of pinto beans doesn't hurt either. More often that not I make it more as a stew - dice up the chicken into bite-sized pieces brown them in olive oil then throw in the rest of the ingredients (except the avocado of course) and let it do its thing. Great with regular white rice and the leftovers are superb in warm flour tortillas.

So easy and so delicious! I would say the only changes I made were to use fresh garlic instead of the Goya minced and I didn't need the sliced pimientos for garnish. It was great without it. And I used boneless skinless chicken thighs which was what I had on hand. Next time I'll try cutting the oil down to 2 tbsp. to cut down on fat a little. But the whole family loved this and my kids can be pretty picky eaters.

The fisrt time I made this it was salty and the rice was mushy. The Adobo chicken buillon sazon seasoning packet pimentos and alcaparrados ALL contain salt. When I seasoned the chicken I treated the adobo like it was salt (sprinkle VERY lightly). Also I used a small red bell pepperbin place of the pimentos and rinsed off some capers in place of the alcapparado. You can put the frozen peas in the rice before you pour the water in. I also increased the rice to 2 cups and used about 3&3/4) cups of water.

Absolutely Delicious!!! Extremely easy to make and cooks fairly quickly. Cheap meal that feeds alot of people and tastes great! Would def reccommend to others. Very authentic tasting. My only thing to point out is the chicken doesnt shred of the bone so at the end take a fork and pull apart chicken from the bones and mix in. That is if you prefer it that way.	absolutely delicious !!! extremely easy to make and cooks fairly quickly . cheap meal that feeds alot of people and tastes great ! would def reccommend to others . very authentic tasting . my only thing to point out is the chicken doesnt shred of the bone so at the end take a fork and pull apart chicken from the bones and mix in . that is if you prefer it that way .	1
I very much plan on using this recipe A LOT from now on. I have always had a hard time figuring out how to make this dish this way but couldn't so would end up going to bodegas. Heh.

The overall flavor of this was quite good. i didn't have enough bacon drippings and was glad i didn't. i used the 2 tablesp in the dressing(all i really had left over) and did not add any additional oil to make up for it. i cooked the mushrooms in olive oil. next time i will lessen the amount of olive oil as well in the dressing as it was much to oily for my taste and some of the sweetness from the balsamic was lost. Also added thin slices red pepper sautéed with the mushroom for additional color and texture. i served it with grilled salmon for protein.	the overall flavor of this was quite good . i did n't have enough bacon drippings and was glad i did n't . i used the 2 tablesp in the dressing -lrb- all i really had left over -rrb- and did not add any additional o il to make up for it . i cooked the mushrooms in olive oil . next time i will lessen the amount of olive oil as well in the dressing as it was much to oily for my taste and some of the sweetness from th e balsamic was lost . also added thin slices red pepper sautéed with the mushroom for additional color and texture . i served it with grilled salmon for protein .	1

I'm always happy to be the first reviewer of a new recipe and report that I enjoyed it and recommend it. This is not a unique pasta salad but it's a good one and the submitter is correct - the bacon and cheddar DOES make it better. In this case I needed something at the last minute and this was good filling and simple. I find that often it's the basic recipes the non-fussy non-fancy recipes that are the best. I stuck pretty much to the submitter's intent only adding a little sour cream as I always do to mayonnaise-based salads to mellow out the tang of the mayo and some thawed frozen peas. This was exactly what I had in mind for our impromptu grilled burgers dinner tonight.	i 'm always happy to be the first reviewer of a new recipe and report that i enjoyed it and recommend it . this is not a unique pasta salad but it 's a good one and the submitter is correct - the bacon a nd cheddar does make it better . in this case i needed something at the last minute and this was good filling and simple . i find that often it 's the basic recipes the non-fussy non-fancy recipes that a re the best . i stuck pretty much to the submitter 's intent only adding a little sour cream as i always do to mayonnaise-based salads to mellow out the tang of the mayo and some thawed frozen peas . thi s was exactly what i had in mind for our impromptu grilled burgers dinner tonight .	1

In looking for a pasta salad recipe that included bacon I found this one. I was drawn to the simplicity of ingredients and inclusion of cheddar cheese along with the bacon and mayonnaise. I will definitely make this one again I did add a bit of sour cream to the mixture of mayo and ranch dressing as per other reviewers if anything next time I would add a bit more bacon and a little extra ranch dressing This was very easy to make and crowd pleasing.	in looking for a pasta salad recipe that included bacon i found this one . i was drawn to the simplicity of ingredients and inclusion of cheddar cheese along with the bacon and mayonnaise . i will defin itely make this one again i did add a bit of sour cream to the mixture of mayo and ranch dressing as per other reviewers if anything next time i would add a bit more bacon and a little extra ranch dre ssing this was very easy to make and crowd pleasing .	1
This salad was ok but I had to adjust the recipe. Using a full pound of macaroni I had to almost double the ranch dressing. I used shredded cheese because that's what I had on hand I think I liked it better than I would have liked cubed. I also wish I had used miracle whip instead of mayo because it needed a little zing (I guess I could have added a little vinegar but didn't think about it at the time). Good starter recipe and easily adjustable to your tastes.	this salad was ok but i had to adjust the recipe . using a full pound of macaroni i had to almost double the ranch dressing . i used shredded cheese because that 's what i had on hand i think i liked it better than i would have liked cubed . i also wish i had used miracle whip instead of mayo because it needed a little zing -lrb- i guess i could have added a little vinegar but did n't think about it at the time -rrb- . good starter recipe and easily adjustable to your tastes .	1
We love this salad! I've made this a few times now with minimal changes. I usually use whole wheat pasta and do 3/4 c mayo and 1/4 sour cream. I use shredded cheddar.

I haven't met too many quiches I didn't like but I thought this was a little better than most, I think, due to the sour cream.  My husband had to ask if there were eggs in it.  I could not find wild rice so ended up using another whole grain, dark colored rice called Forbidden Rice. I'm really not sure the rice added anything to the dish so you could easily substitute a chopped vegetable.	i have n't met too many quiches i did n't like but i thought this was a little better than most , i think , due to the sour cream . my husband had to ask if there were eggs in it . i could not find wild r ice so ended up using another whole grain , dark colored rice called forbidden rice . i 'm really not sure the rice added anything to the dish so you could easily substitute a chopped vegetable .	1

This quiche was a big hit for my family's leftover Christmas ham. I would prefer not to have the rice in there just because there is already a lot of starch with the dough and it's filling as is. I suggest skip the rice and steam some vegetables to have on the side instead.	this quiche was a big hit for my family 's leftover christmas ham . i would prefer not to have the rice in there just because there is already a lot of starch with the dough and it 's filling as is . i su ggest skip the rice and steam some vegetables to have on the side instead .	1

I too am in VA where brunswick stew becomes a household staple during hunting season. Scratch the ground meats use pulled pork roast or steak. Add a pkg. of frozen lima beans. Also switch to niblet corn (1 can) 2 cans cream corn. A little old bay definitely helps as well. This is a lot less expensive and much better tasting than the 10 pint we get from the Ruritan Clubs.

Compared recipes and took best of each - used crock pot served with cornbread. Changes: 2lbs. boneless chicken thighs 1lb. leftover pork roast 1/2 cup diced smoked ham plus 2 slices crumbled turkey bacon in place of all meats. Added 1/2 cup sliced okra 2 cups lima beans 1 clove minced garlic 1 can chicken broth dash of worcestershire. Replaced ketchup with tomato puree and creamed corn with 2 cups frozen. Increased BBQ sauce to 1 cup.

Absolutely the BEST stew I've ever had! I was a little sceptical when reading the ingredients and noticed there were no potatos but WOW! The only change I made was that I left out the chicken and added stew meat that I floured and browned before adding to the mixture. Hubby loved it too.

As a girl who grew up in Georgia and has lately been living in Colorado it's so great to have a recipe for this as you won't find it anywhere outside the South and the only way I can get it is to make it myself! This recipe turned out great just like it should have tasted! The only modification I made was to use only one can of the creamed corn (not being a huge fan of canned cream corn) and added additional frozen corn kernals. Also a couple notes-Hot Sauce (like Tobasco) is essential not so much to make it spicy but to really give it the flavor that makes it brunswick stew. Also many southerners would never add vegetables (potatoes green beans oh the sacrilige!!). So if you want a true brunswick stew stick to the basics (onion etc.) in the recipe. Also instead of the ground pork it is also good with shredded pork roast. This is especially great when eaten with BBQ on a fall Saturday afternoon watching a football game!

None of my family members liked it. I really disliked the sweet taste of the soup. Second of all besides having a bad taste it was very bland ingredients wise. I definitely wouldn't make this again as a soup - however I think it has potential as a dip. If I decreased the liquid added more salt and changed a few things here and there I think this would be a decent dip.	none of my family members liked it . i really disliked the sweet taste of the soup . second of all besides having a bad taste it was very bland ingredients wise . i definitely would n't make this again as a soup - however i think it has potential as a dip . if i decreased the liquid added more salt and changed a few things here and there i think this would be a decent dip .	1
"I've made this twice and I have to tell you the second time I cheated.  I browned the roast then put it in the crock pot and dumped the minced garlic, you know the stuff in a jar and the rosemary on top of the roast and then cut holes in it a kinda pushed the stuff inside and left some on top too.  I didn't make a paste.  Then I drizled a little olive oil on tbe top added salt, pepper and accent.  Threw some dehydrated minced onions on top.  Added the wine and cooked it in the crock pot for 8 hrs.  It came out just as good if not better then the first time.  
This is the absolute best pork roast.

I'm not even sure if I used a loin.  I used that big giant pork roast and cut it and made 3 roasts out of it.

"What defines taste for this recipe? What can you substitute for what?
1. Keep red onion. Do not substitute it.
2. Keep bacon. You can use more bacon then requested, still be fine.
3. Raisins. I like Jumbo White raisins. Please do not use those little brown once. You need sweet-sour taste. So as previous reviewers said: you can use red grapes, halved; you can use craizins. Sweet-n-Sour!
4. Sunflower seeds or roasted almonds - doesn't matter. They both taste good in this salad. Add them before serving, so they retain cranchinnes.
5. And dressing.
For dressing you can substitute Real Mayo for Light or for extra Light or for Sour Cream+Mustard+LemonJuice+Salt. Really does not make any difference. You can substitute sugar for Splenda. You can use Red Wine Vinegar.
The taste should be sweet-salty and a little sour.
What important is the amount. If you use too little - it'll be too dry. If you use to much - it'll be soup. Add the dressing gradually. Remember that after a night in refrigirator it is going to absorb some fluid.

Now - if you do substitutions for Mayo, make sure this thing has salt in it, because if not and you use raisins... they will become grapes again :-), and sometime quite huge grapes.

This is a good recipe, but I don't think everyone made it right.  A few reviewers mentioned the bacon and the sunflower seeds getting soft.  The recipe states to put them in right before serving.  This leaves them nice and crunchy and gives the salad a nice balance.	this is a good recipe , but i do n't think everyone made it right . a few reviewers mentioned the bacon and the sunflower seeds getting soft . the recipe states to put them in right before serving . thi s leaves them nice and crunchy and gives the salad a nice balance .	1

This stuff is awesome. I didn't like raw broccoli before now but now this is my favorite vegetable dish. I made it with red seedless grapes cut in half instead of raisins (in the amount of 2X the raisins that the recipe calls for). I also used prepared bacon crumbles the kind that come in a plastic pouch intended as a salad topping; and low-fat mayonnaise. Be sure to use white wine vinegar--I think it makes a big difference. I think you could add just about any fruit or maybe some white chicken chunks for a complete meal. I'm going to try it with chicken and diced apple next time.

This is a great recipe and is almost identical to one I've been making for years.  I only use 1/4 of the red onion, otherwise it is too strong for our taste; also, I use sunflower seeds and apple cider vinegar instead of almonds and white wine vinegar.  For an absolutely awesome pasta salad, add (2) 9-oz. pkgs. of cheese-filled tortellini, cooked al dente, then well-drained and cooled.  It makes a terrific picnic and potluck pasta salad and always gets rave reviews.	this is a great recipe and is almost identical to one i 've been making for years . i only use 1/4 of the red onion , otherwise it is too strong for our taste ; also , i use sunflower seeds and apple cide r vinegar instead of almonds and white wine vinegar . for an absolutely awesome pasta salad , add -lrb- 2 -rrb- 9 oz . pkgs . of cheese-filled tortellini , cooked al dente , then well-drained and cooled . it makes a terrific picnic and potluck pasta salad and always gets rave reviews .	1

Very good recipe however I did make a few modifications. I used turkey bacon dried cranberries and sunflower seeds in place of the bacon raisins & almonds. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and used Balsamic vinegar. My husband who won't touch a raisin and thought he didn't like dried cranberries asked for seconds!!

Very versatile and portable used diet mayo the raisins really add to it but soften by running under hot water in a sieve to plump them up. Healthy and Yummy!!

FABULOUS!!!!!! Next time I will reduce the amount of the sugar or use Splenda. I thought it was a tad sweet but oh so good. I cannot wait to make this again for friends and can see this becoming a mainstay at BBQ's and potlucks. Looks so pretty too. I have to admit I just had some for breakfast and even the leftovers were great. Also used real bacon bits instead of frying some up and ready cut up fresh broccoli from Sams Club. Saved a lot of prep time.	fabulous !!!!!! next time i will reduce the amount of the sugar or use splenda . i thought it was a tad sweet but oh so good . i can not wait to make this again for friends and can see this becoming a mai nstay at bbq 's and potlucks . looks so pretty too . i have to admit i just had some for breakfast and even the leftovers were great . also used real bacon bits instead of frying some up and ready cut up fresh broccoli from sams club . saved a lot of prep time .	1

Easy and delicious - plus it's a great way to use up leftover grilled chicken! I didn't have pecans so I subbed toasted walnuts instead. I used a Granny Smith Apple and red seedless grapes vs. green. I also used dried cranberries vs. raisins. I mixed the dressing in a separate bowl before folding it into the chicken and other ingredients. For the dressing I used 1/2 cup of Hellman's light mayo cut with 1/4 cup of reduced fat sour cream along with the curry and a bit of salt and pepper. It chilled for just a couple of hours and it came out really good. Overall a great combination of flavors! Especially good on whole grain bread!	easy and delicious - plus it 's a great way to use up leftover grilled chicken ! i did n't have pecans so i subbed toasted walnuts instead . i used a granny smith apple and red seedless grapes vs. green . i also used dried cranberries vs. raisins . i mixed the dressing in a separate bowl before folding it into the chicken and other ingredients . for the dressing i used 1/2 cup of hellman 's light mayo cut with 1/4 cup of reduced fat sour cream along with the curry and a bit of salt and pepper . it chilled for just a couple of hours and it came out really good . overall a great combination of flavors ! es pecially good on whole grain bread !	1
LOVE this recipe my favorite of all recipes I have tried at this site. It is healthy relatively simple to make can be made ahead of time (although Hubby keeps eating it up). I often substitute depending on what I have on hand without any problems: canned chicken leftover rotisserie chicken leftover turkey fuji apples walnuts cranberries yellow onions. This is one of the few recipes my husband and my own mother has complimented me on more than once.	love this recipe my favorite of all recipes i have tried at this site . it is healthy relatively simple to make can be made ahead of time -lrb- although hubby keeps eating it up -rrb- . i often substitute dependi ng on what i have on hand without any problems : canned chicken leftover rotisserie chicken leftover turkey fuji apples walnuts cranberries yellow onions . this is one of the few recipes my husband and my own mother has complimented me on more than once .	1

Using ideas from previous reviewers, I added several dashes of poultry seasoning and garlic powder to the mayo mixture.  Instead of 1 1/2 cups dried cranberries, I used 1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1/2 cup dried cherries, and about 1 cup of halved seedless green grapes.  Omitted the green bell pepper since I don't care for it.  Outstanding!! Huge hit at the covered-dish party I brought it to.  Hubby loved it also!!  I don't believe it serves 12 as listed, unless you make small sandwiches.  I served it on lettuce leaves and it perhaps served 6 to 8.	using ideas from previous reviewers , i added several dashes of poultry seasoning and garlic powder to the mayo mixture . instead of 1 1/2 cups dried cranberries , i used 1/2 cup dried cranberries , 1/2 cup dried cherries , and about 1 cup of halved seedless green grapes . omitted the green bell pepper since i do n't care for it . outstanding !! huge hit at the covered-dish party i brought it to . hubby loved it also !! i do n't believe it serves 12 as listed , unless you make small sandwiches . i served it on lettuce leaves and it perhaps served 6 to 8 .	1
This is a wonderful chicken salad recipe. I was looking for something close to Arby's chicken salad and this was it. I omitted the green pepper and added chopped apples and sliced grapes. I highly recommend giving this recipe a shot. I'm glad I did!	this is a wonderful chicken salad recipe . i was looking for something close to arby 's chicken salad and this was it . i omitted the green pepper and added chopped apples and sliced grapes . i highly rec ommend giving this recipe a shot . i 'm glad i did !	1
I'm on a chicken salad binge.There are many great recipes for it on this side but this one is almost perfect. It tends to be a little bland but the addition of poultry seasoning garlic powder to the mayo and some minced red onion makes it superb.Thanks Elaine.	i 'm on a chicken salad binge.there are many great recipes for it on this side but this one is almost perfect . it tends to be a little bland but the addition of poultry seasoning garlic powder to the m ayo and some minced red onion makes it superb.thanks elaine .	1
I've made this twice now. It's good right on the same day it's made however it's excellent on day two or three. Give the flavors a chance to meld together. Beautiful on a croissant sandwich.	i 've made this twice now . it 's good right on the same day it 's made however it 's excellent on day two or three . give the flavors a chance to meld together . beautiful on a croissant sandwich .	1
Really good! Love the craisins & blend of flavors. Used mayo/miracle whip combo. Used red bell pepper because I had one. Used leftover rotisserie chicken (shredded). Toasted pecans. This is a great recipe. Don't leave anything out--everything adds to the overall flavor! Be brave! I was & I was not disappointed. Neither was my family. Everyone stood around in the kitchen eating it on crackers! Will be making again!!!	really good ! love the craisins & blend of flavors . used mayo/miracle whip combo . used red bell pepper because i had one . used leftover rotisserie chicken -lrb- shredded -rrb- . toasted pecans . this is a great re cipe . do n't leave anything out -- everything adds to the overall flavor ! be brave ! i was & i was not disappointed . neither was my family . everyone stood around in the kitchen eating it on crackers ! will be making again !!!	1

This is very good. I served it out croissants and my guests loved it. My husband said that maybe less cranberries next time and he is a cranberry lover!

I subsituted raisins (grapes sound good, too) for the cranberries, left out the bell pepper and served it on raisin bread like a local restaurant does.

This was o.k. I followed the recipe exactly and had it the same day as well as the next day. It was better the day after...but a bit dry IMO. There are so many dry ingredients and such little dressing that you can barely coat it all. Way too much crunch. There were more crunchies (bell pepper onion celery pecans) than there was chicken...and the chicken unfortunately took a backseat to the other ingredients. I have no paprika complaints but not sure what it did for the recipe. Maybe you could substitute onion powder for the green onions? And I'm going to skip the pecans maybe go with slivered almonds next chicken salad recipe I try; also nix the bell pepper.	this was o.k. i followed the recipe exactly and had it the same day as well as the next day . it was better the day after ... but a bit dry imo . there are so many dry ingredients and such little dressing that you can barely coat it all . way too much crunch . there were more crunchies -lrb- bell pepper onion celery pecans -rrb- than there was chicken ... and the chicken unfortunately took a backseat to the other i ngredients . i have no paprika complaints but not sure what it did for the recipe . maybe you could substitute onion powder for the green onions ? and i 'm going to skip the pecans maybe go with slivered almonds next chicken salad recipe i try ; also nix the bell pepper .	1
This is a wonderful salad and very forgiving as you can add almost any fruit to it and it still comes out superb! Try adding mandarin oranges - you won't be disappointed..... Side note: A little oily for my taste so will probably cut back on the amount of oil called for next time!	this is a wonderful salad and very forgiving as you can add almost any fruit to it and it still comes out superb ! try adding mandarin oranges - you wo n't be disappointed ... . side note : a little oily for my taste so will probably cut back on the amount of oil called for next time !	1
oh my. i wish i could give this more stars. this salad was amazing; the best i've ever tasted. my man who is usually very cool with his compliments ate very noisily and raved with every bite. it was also fairly simple to put together. this will definitely become a staple. bravo. p.s. i left out the bacon.	oh my . i wish i could give this more stars . this salad was amazing ; the best i 've ever tasted . my man who is usually very cool with his compliments ate very noisily and raved with every bite . it was a lso fairly simple to put together . this will definitely become a staple . bravo . p.s. i left out the bacon .	1
The thing that makes this salad awesome is the curried cashews...wow!!!! I added some goat cheese and craisins as well. A keeper!!! Edit: After making this salad a bunch of times I found that the dressing is best when cutting back to 1/4 cup olive oil (otherwise too oily tasting) and adding 1/2 tsp of paprika. I also like to add fresh raspberries to the salad.

This is an absolutely amazing salad! The blend of flavors is very creative and super delicious. My husband and I ate it all in one sitting! I didn't have fresh rosemary and used dry instead. There was a lot of dressing left over. The next time I make this I'll only make half the dressing. I'll also try adding some goat cheese.	this is an absolutely amazing salad ! the blend of flavors is very creative and super delicious . my husband and i ate it all in one sitting ! i did n't have fresh rosemary and used dry instead . there was a lot of dressing left over . the next time i make this i 'll only make half the dressing . i 'll also try adding some goat cheese .	1
This salad is awesome!! I had it at my Mom's house and everyone loved it. This recipes is missing a few ingrediants compared to our recipe. For the dressing we put in 3 tbls toasted sesame seeds and 1 teasp. minced garlic. It also suggests you use peanut oil if you have it in place of the olive or veg. oil. With these extra ingrediants I give this recipe a 5 or in my rating system a 10. Second note: Try including Arugula (rocket) in your salad mix. It has a great nutty flavor when it is picked young and will really compliment the flavors in the rest of the salad.	this salad is awesome !! i had it at my mom 's house and everyone loved it . this recipes is missing a few ingrediants compared to our recipe . for the dressing we put in 3 tbls toasted sesame seeds and 1 teasp . minced garlic . it also suggests you use peanut oil if you have it in place of the olive or veg . oil . with these extra ingrediants i give this recipe a 5 or in my rating system a 10 . second not e : try including arugula -lrb- rocket -rrb- in your salad mix . it has a great nutty flavor when it is picked young and will really compliment the flavors in the rest of the salad .	1
This was a delicious salad! My husband and I both enjoyed it! We made a few changes. I noticed that we were out of curry powder so I used lemon pepper which turned out great on the cashews and worked well with the salad. We also used veggie bacon. My husband had his with chicken which makes it a great main dish salad!

Concept is good; execution -- not so much. Came out way too sweet for my taste; I like a salad that tastes like vegetables not dessert. Halve the honey and oil and eschew the brown sugar entirely. Another reviewer's suggestion to add goat cheese was right on. It lends a nice tang to the dish.	concept is good ; execution -- not so much . came out way too sweet for my taste ; i like a salad that tastes like vegetables not dessert . halve the honey and oil and eschew the brown sugar entirely . ano ther reviewer 's suggestion to add goat cheese was right on . it lends a nice tang to the dish .	1
This was delicious when fresh. Very flavorful. Good as leftovers the second day however bacon tends to get a little soggy. Second time I made used roasted pine nuts and sprinkled the bacon and nuts on each serving so bacon was not soggy as a leftover. The pine nuts were an excellent substitute for the almonds.	this was delicious when fresh . very flavorful . good as leftovers the second day however bacon tends to get a little soggy . second time i made used roasted pine nuts and sprinkled the bacon and nuts on each serving so bacon was not soggy as a leftover . the pine nuts were an excellent substitute for the almonds .	1
I used 4 tablespoons of Bac-o s instead of the actual bacon because I am a vegetarian but it's also healthier and makes the prep time shorter. But if going to use baco s instead of real bacon only add it right before serving because otherwise they get mushy and don't taste good. I also used light mayonnaise and added some raisins.

This recipe was recommended to me by a co-worker who makes it every year for Christmas. I also made it for Christmas dinner. Wow! It is awesome. I got many compliments. I do agree with others who state that it is time consuming but it is well worth it. I used 2 1/2 heads of broccoli and doubled everything but the sugar bacon and nuts to lower the calories. There is no need to use so much sugar as the grapes give the salad the sweetness needed. This recipe will definitely join my favourites.	this recipe was recommended to me by a co-worker who makes it every year for christmas . i also made it for christmas dinner . wow ! it is awesome . i got many compliments . i do agree with others who stat e that it is time consuming but it is well worth it . i used 2 1/2 heads of broccoli and doubled everything but the sugar bacon and nuts to lower the calories . there is no need to use so much sugar as the grapes give the salad the sweetness needed . this recipe will definitely join my favourites .	1

This was a very tasty salad that as suggested turned into a meal in itself!! I ate it for supper last night breakfast and lunch today - yummy! There is just the right blend of crunchy with tangy and the tastes were very complementary. I used maple bacon and green grapes and it was delicious. My husband generally isn't a big broccoli fan and really really like this one too.

This is one of our favorite summer meals. I use my own fajita seasoning organic black beans and my own homemade salsa. This is also good with avocado. I like to mix the salsa with a tablespoon of sour cream with the salsa to make it stretch a little more and to make it creamy. This is a great way to stretch the little meat you do have on skinny week's before payday. To make it a little more filling you can also add in cooked mexican rice. This makes a great filling for wraps too.	this is one of our favorite summer meals . i use my own fajita seasoning organic black beans and my own homemade salsa . this is also good with avocado . i like to mix the salsa with a tablespoon of sour cream with the salsa to make it stretch a little more and to make it creamy . this is a great way to stretch the little meat you do have on skinny week 's before payday . to make it a little more fillin g you can also add in cooked mexican rice . this makes a great filling for wraps too .	1
Great for a quick and easy meal! I grilled my chicken vs. pan frying and used a homemade fajita seasoning. I used regular corn and left it cold as well as the beans. I also didn't bother adding any additional fajita seasoning. I added some Mexican blend cheese and some thin sliced avocado. I topped it off with a dollup of sour cream and some thin sliced green onion. This was great served with Ranch dressing and tortilla wedges on the side.	great for a quick and easy meal ! i grilled my chicken vs. pan frying and used a homemade fajita seasoning . i used regular corn and left it cold as well as the beans . i also did n't bother adding any ad ditional fajita seasoning . i added some mexican blend cheese and some thin sliced avocado . i topped it off with a dollup of sour cream and some thin sliced green onion . this was great served with ranc h dressing and tortilla wedges on the side .	1
This is a very tasty salad and a great change from ordinary Taco Salad. It's also very flexible. I made a couple additions- avocado cilantro and mango.

Yummy recipe! Since I'm not fond of salsa in salads I left it out and for the dressing I substituted a cup of Caesar dressing to which I added 1/4 packet of dry Taco Seasoning and 1/2 teaspoon cumin.Garnished with a dollop of sour cream...and Voila!

WOW! What a salad. I have made this so many times and the bowl is always empty!! I have also used the dressing on other in other salads. The dressing is great on plain lettuce.

My boyfriend doesnt like spinach and he doesnt like salad...so when he ate two plates of this I was shocked!! I wanted a light salad for Valentine's Day so i just put water chestnuts and walnuts on top of spinach with this dressing. He said it was the best dressing ever and he was only eating salad cuz the dressing was sooo good. A note I tried using less dishes and not lugging out the food processor...doesn't work!! You MUST put it in the food processor or else it looks realy disgusting and lumpy.

I really like this recipe i'm a vegetarian so I did a few substitutes (I use vegetable broth and no chicken. I also don't like olives so I didn't use any..) The recipe was still great and it's an awesome protein dish that I can throw together really quickly using whatever vegetables I have on hand. I have made a habit of making this dish in large quantities then refrigerating it so I can take it to work later in the week. It's the kinda dish that tastes as good or better on the second day.

Excellent!

O....M....G!!!!! DINNER LAST NIGHT WAS AMAZING! My husband and I LOVED this. He's not big on trying new things but when I told him about how healthy quinoa is and had a way to make it that he'd like he went for it. I read over the reviews to see what adjustments we could make and with them it was delicious! We omitted the salt used half the lemon juice and added chickpeas. I cooked the quinoa in vegetable broth and used red instead of green pepper (that's all I had). I also am weird about raw onions so when the chicken was almost done I threw in the onions so they could cook a little. We will definitely make this over and over again! Thanks a ton!!!

This is my new favorite pasta dish and my favorite recipe on this site! The only changes I made were I used a whole pound of bacon (it was just easier) I used regular tomatoes (both yellow and red) because I didn't have any cherry ones and I ended up using green leaf lettuce because my rinky dink grocery store didn't have arugula - I could have used fresh spinach I guess. I also made Chef John's creme fraiche ahead of time (although I could have cut it in half for this recipe - you can find the recipe on this site.) The creme fraiche made this recipe so plan ahead to make this dish. I would not substitue it for anything since I've already done it this way! The creme fraiche didn't overwhelm the other flavors but gave it a subtle richness. I should have taken a picture because the yellow and red tomatoes along with the green lettuce made an attractive dish. My teenagers also loved this and I know my husband would have but he was out of town and by the time he got home the leftovers were gone. Poor guy. I didn't think it was as good left over as it was fresh though. This dish is now in my permanent rotation forever and always!	this is my new favorite pasta dish and my favorite recipe on this site ! the only changes i made were i used a whole pound of bacon -lrb- it was just easier -rrb- i used regular tomatoes -lrb- both yellow and red -rrb- be cause i did n't have any cherry ones and i ended up using green leaf lettuce because my rinky dink grocery store did n't have arugula - i could have used fresh spinach i guess . i also made chef john 's c reme fraiche ahead of time -lrb- although i could have cut it in half for this recipe - you can find the recipe on this site . -rrb- the creme fraiche made this recipe so plan ahead to make this dish . i would no t substitue it for anything since i 've already done it this way ! the creme fraiche did n't overwhelm the other flavors but gave it a subtle richness . i should have taken a picture because the yellow an d red tomatoes along with the green lettuce made an attractive dish . my teenagers also loved this and i know my husband would have but he was out of town and by the time he got home the leftovers were gone . poor guy . i did n't think it was as good left over as it was fresh though . this dish is now in my permanent rotation forever and always !	1
This is simply wonderful!! I too followed the directions exactly and found myself gobbling it up which I usually don't do with meals I've cooked. My husband also went for seconds. My store didn't have the creme fraiche so I had to make my own. Super easy recipes online! I'm also a huge fan of BLT's so that might have something to do with my love for this dish.

I made this with sour cream the first time and we really loved it. I added sun-dried tomatoes for a little more flavor. I wanted to try it with the creme fraiche so I made it again. We preferred the tang the sour cream added for sure so I'll be making it again and again but with the sour cream. I omitted the lemon as we didn't care for it in this dish.	i made this with sour cream the first time and we really loved it . i added sun-dried tomatoes for a little more flavor . i wanted to try it with the creme fraiche so i made it again . we preferred the t ang the sour cream added for sure so i 'll be making it again and again but with the sour cream . i omitted the lemon as we did n't care for it in this dish .	1

This was just ok. Arugula is not my favorite and I should have known the kids wouldn't like it but wanted to follow the recipe exactly the first time. The arugula overwhelmed the dish in my opinion and it didn't resemble a BLT at all because of that. I think perhaps with spinach or kale this would be better.	this was just ok . arugula is not my favorite and i should have known the kids would n't like it but wanted to follow the recipe exactly the first time . the arugula overwhelmed the dish in my opinion an d it did n't resemble a blt at all because of that . i think perhaps with spinach or kale this would be better .	1
Very good combination of flavors. I used (1) 1lb. box of mini penne pasta 1 lb of bacon. I doubled the rest of the ingredients other than the cream fraise which I used the entire jar I had just made.

Every so often I like to play around with egg salad to do something a little different from the traditional mayonnaise/celery thing.  This was sensationally delicious!  I used full fat sour cream and mayo, green onion other than the red, and real, crumbled bacon, but otherwise stuck to the recipe as written. And I will next time too! Looking over the reviews, if you omit bacon, omit onion, omit the mustard, etc.--are you really trying or reviewing THIS recipe?  I like the addition of sour cream (I do in all my mayonnaise-based salads as well) as it mellows out the tang of the mayonnaise. I've used Dijon mustard before and love it, but it was the bacon and horseradish that really were this recipe's claim to distinction!

I make this all the time. I have put the bacon in before but prefer it without. I scale up or down the horseradish depending on who I'm serving it to. I also love to add a bit of celery and some sliced green olives with pimentos. Excellent on toasted sourdough. Always a hit. I love to see people trying to figure out what's in it.

Wow! Was this ever good! I scaled it way back because it was just lunch for me so I may not have gotten the proportions exactly right but they were close. I used a piece of real bacon and onion powder since I didn't have red onion. Ate it in a pita and finished wishing I had more.

This is without a doubt the best egg salad recipe I've had. I wanted to try something different and this truly fit the bill. Don't let anything out especially the bacon. I didn't measure my ingredients and it turned out great. I put a little too much mustard in but that was my fault. I didn't think that I had Dijon mustard so I put spicy brown in and then found the Dijon so added more. It was still as the title says awesome egg salad!	this is without a doubt the best egg salad recipe i 've had . i wanted to try something different and this truly fit the bill . do n't let anything out especially the bacon . i did n't measure my ingredient s and it turned out great . i put a little too much mustard in but that was my fault . i did n't think that i had dijon mustard so i put spicy brown in and then found the dijon so added more . it was stil l as the title says awesome egg salad !	1
AWESOME! I used 8 eggs (all I had) so I scaled to 1/4 cup 1 TBS Mayo and 1/4 cup 1 TBS Sour Cream. I used 2 tsp dry mustard powder because I didn't have any Dijon (I'll use Dijon next time). I used yellow onion because that's what I had. I omitted the bacon (personal preference). Added 1 tsp dried dill weed. I too thought that 1 teaspoon (rather than 1 TBS) prepared horseradish was sufficient for my taste but hey I am a coward.	awesome ! i used 8 eggs -lrb- all i had -rrb- so i scaled to 1/4 cup 1 tbs mayo and 1/4 cup 1 tbs sour cream . i used 2 tsp dry mustard powder because i did n't have any dijon -lrb- i 'll use dijon next time -rrb- . i used ye llow onion because that 's what i had . i omitted the bacon -lrb- personal preference -rrb- . added 1 tsp dried dill weed . i too thought that 1 teaspoon -lrb- rather than 1 tbs -rrb- prepared horseradish was sufficient for my taste but hey i am a coward .	1
This was GREAT. It will be my way to make egg salad from now on. Really didn't notice the horseradish but the bacon and sour cream made it so good.

I really liked this recipe. The only thing I might change is omitting the bacon don't quite understand why you would want bacon but I would also up the horseradish. Mine also turned out very runny not sure if that is from the sour cream but I might either use regular sour cream instead of light or omit it all together. Other than that the whole family enjoyed it.	i really liked this recipe . the only thing i might change is omitting the bacon do n't quite understand why you would want bacon but i would also up the horseradish . mine also turned out very runny not sure if that is from the sour cream but i might either use regular sour cream instead of light or omit it all together . other than that the whole family enjoyed it .	1

I tried this recipe and it came out pretty good. The only thing I will definitely add next time is more cheese. I also added some milk to the recipe to give it a fluffier consistency. Other than that will try again. What I like most about this recipe is that it can be tweaked to my specifications add bell pepper or mushroom use bacon instead of sausage. I will keep in the recipe box for future use.

After reading other reviews I changed this up a little myself. I used bacon instead of sausage (my husband likes bacon a lot more).. I added some shredded cheddar cheese (about 1/2 c) hot sauce (2 tbsp) and instead of eggs I used the southwestern egg beaters (3 c = 12 eggs).. I had a little left over after I filled the muffin tins but I just scrambled them up and fed them to my husband.

I loved this recipe for my low carb diet. I made three different kinds with whatever I could find in my fridge and they all turned out well. My husband absolutly loved them and even took them to work for lunch. I froze a bunch because I made a huge batch and they are great to just pop in the microwave.	i loved this recipe for my low carb diet . i made three different kinds with whatever i could find in my fridge and they all turned out well . my husband absolutly loved them and even took them to work for lunch . i froze a bunch because i made a huge batch and they are great to just pop in the microwave .	1

I made a half recipe of this (a little over a quarter of a pound) and used ground turkey that I spiced up to taste like ground pork breakfast sausage (sage paprika little red pepper flake brown sugar coriander garlic powder onion powder). I ended up leaving out the onion only because I figured that I had added onion powder and didn't want to cut up an onion just to use a little anyhow. I've made scrambled egg muffins before so I knew to grease the heckfire out of my tins before adding the egg mixture. To make it easier I evenly portioned the cooked turkey meat into the six muffin tins then poured the egg mix over each individual portion. This was really easy and well loved by all of us. Next time I might add chopped ham and shredded cheese or do all chopped vegetables.

The flavors in this salad are 10-star. A little heavy on the dressing and blue cheese - I used a lighter hand. Also used walnuts because I didn't have pecans. Excellent salad - my guys all raved.

this is (basically) a salad I've made for years everyone loves it! haven't used bacon but why not! I use toasted pecans because I like them. 4 servings. 1/4 C walnut pieces toasted 1 medium head Romaine torn 1/2 bunch watercress 1 large Granny Smith apple cored & sliced thinly & brushed lightly with lemon juice to prevent discolouration 4 ozs. Stilton crumbled. Dressing: whisk 6 TBLspns. olive oil 3 TBLspns. raspberry or Balsamic vinegar salt & pepper to taste in small bowl. when ready to serve toss greens with dressing arrange on plate. arrange apple slices around the edges (pointy ends to centre) sprinkle with cheese top centre with nuts.

I was nervous to experiment with a new dish for our party... especially because there had only been 2 reviews... but it was SO good!! Everyone loved them! The pear had such a delicate flavor you could hardly tell it was there I used d'anjou pears I don't know if another kind would taste different. Don't skimp on the cheese... I cooked up 4 sweet onions (3 inches in diameter) and had about a cup left over. Three onions would have done just fine.	i was nervous to experiment with a new dish for our party ... especially because there had only been 2 reviews ... but it was so good !! everyone loved them ! the pear had such a delicate flavor you could hardly tell it was there i used d'anjou pears i do n't know if another kind would taste different . do n't skimp on the cheese ... i cooked up 4 sweet onions -lrb- 3 inches in diameter -rrb- and had about a cup le ft over . three onions would have done just fine .	1
I really liked these but the whole process was a little strange. The flavor was good and the guests ate them up but the next time I make them I will use the puff pastry cups. I tried it both as written in the directions and as one reviewer mentioned stuffing the triangles. both ways didn't get enough filling for me and I ended up with huge bites of puff pastry with only the middle bite with filling. I would highly recommend this recipe and I will make it again just using the cups instead.	i really liked these but the whole process was a little strange . the flavor was good and the guests ate them up but the next time i make them i will use the puff pastry cups . i tried it both as writte n in the directions and as one reviewer mentioned stuffing the triangles . both ways did n't get enough filling for me and i ended up with huge bites of puff pastry with only the middle bite with fillin g. i would highly recommend this recipe and i will make it again just using the cups instead .	1

I'm not a fan of black-eyed peas but my wife is Southern and I wanted her to fulfill her New Year's requirement. This soup is incredibly delicious. I did substitute beef broth for the water / bouillon and I left out the chilies otherwise I stayed true to the recipe. The Ro-Tel tomatoes brought the perfect amount of heat for us. This soup is very meaty and the black-eyed peas play a supporting role bringing a pleasant complexity to the flavor. If you really like them I think that you could easily add another can without overwhelming the soup. I made Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread to go with it. Tomorrow's leftovers will be with rice. I can hardly wait.	i 'm not a fan of black-eyed peas but my wife is southern and i wanted her to fulfill her new year 's requirement . this soup is incredibly delicious . i did substitute beef broth for the water / bouillon and i left out the chilies otherwise i stayed true to the recipe . the ro-tel tomatoes brought the perfect amount of heat for us . this soup is very meaty and the black-eyed peas play a supporting role bringing a pleasant complexity to the flavor . if you really like them i think that you could easily add another can without overwhelming the soup . i made grandmother 's buttermilk cornbread to go with it . tomorrow 's leftovers will be with rice . i can hardly wait .	1
Excellent!!! I didn't have pork sausage so I ground some pork sirloin with my Kitchen Aid mixer and used that. Since it wasn't seasoned as sausage I added about 1/2 teaspoon sage and extra garlic salt. That's the only change I made and this stuff is wonderful! I'm serving with cornbread and can't wait until time to eat! Try this it is excellent!!! edited...Dinner is over and we enjoyed every bite!

Absolutely delish!! This is a quick and easy meal that tastes fantastic! My husband and the kids loved it. We served it with salad and corn chips. The only change I made was adding pinto beans and navy beans instead of the black-eyed peas. It is all I had on hand. Black-eyed peas are beans anyway so I can't imagine the taste would be that much different if I had used the black-eyed peas. This recipe is absolutely worth making.

Very versatile dish- I substitued cannellini beans because I did not have butter beans on hand and I also used marinated artichoke hearts instead. If you don't have the marinated artichokes on hand you could just add a small clove of garlic crushed to the dressing for added flavor. You could really play with the ingredients on this one to suit your tastes!

This is an excellent quick choice! Made it for a picnic at my in-laws and it was a big hit.

AWESOME! I served this for Bunko and the ladies all loved it and asked for the recipe! The first batch I made I followed recipe exactly except for leaving out the bacon cuz we have a vegetarian in our group, and made some changes for the 2nd batch which made it even better (I think!). I reduced the milk to 3 cups whole, 2 cups 1% (cuz that's what we have on hand), and 1 cup chicken broth. (Because the soup is so darned thick and extremely rich!) I also sauteed 1 finely minced carrot for a minute or two, then added 1 minced onion and 1 minced celery stalk til all was soft and tender, then put in a minced garlic clove and sauteed for about another minute. Pureed the entire thing in my Cuisinart and stirred it into the soup along with the cheese, et al. Gave it even MORE flavor--totally over the top! I then ended up stirring the two batches together and dumping the entire thing in my crock pot! I put chopped green onion, bacon, cheese and sour cream in little bowls for everyone to top as they wanted. Yum!	awesome ! i served this for bunko and the ladies all loved it and asked for the recipe ! the first batch i made i followed recipe exactly except for leaving out the bacon cuz we have a vegetarian in our group , and made some changes for the 2 nd batch which made it even better -lrb- i think ! -rrb- . i reduced the milk to 3 cups whole , 2 cups 1 % -lrb- cuz that 's what we have on hand -rrb- , and 1 cup chicken broth . -lrb- because the soup is so darned thick and extremely rich ! -rrb- i also sauteed 1 finely minced carrot for a minute or two , then added 1 minced onion and 1 minced celery stalk til all was soft and tender , then put i n a minced garlic clove and sauteed for about another minute . pureed the entire thing in my cuisinart and stirred it into the soup along with the cheese , et al. . gave it even more flavor -- totally over the top ! i then ended up stirring the two batches together and dumping the entire thing in my crock pot ! i put chopped green onion , bacon , cheese and sour cream in little bowls for everyone to top as they wanted . yum !	1
Excellent soup. I used non-fat milk lower fat cheese and light sour cream. And I kept adding milk to it to thin it out during cooking (definitely no need for whole milk.) I added more black pepper no salt (didn't need it) and used real bacon pieces. I also cut up about half the potatoes into chunks and the rest I chopped more finely. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! It's a keeper.	excellent soup . i used non-fat milk lower fat cheese and light sour cream . and i kept adding milk to it to thin it out during cooking -lrb- definitely no need for whole milk . -rrb- i added more black pepper no salt -lrb- did n't need it -rrb- and used real bacon pieces . i also cut up about half the potatoes into chunks and the rest i chopped more finely . thanks so much for sharing this recipe ! it 's a keeper .	1
This was excellent everyone loved it. I only made minor changes - 6 spuds instead of 9 and I slightly undercooked them in the microwave and then cut them into small hunks when cooled. Then once I had the soup base thickened I threw it all in the crockpot for several hours on low until the potatoes were totally cooked.	this was excellent everyone loved it . i only made minor changes - 6 spuds instead of 9 and i slightly undercooked them in the microwave and then cut them into small hunks when cooled . then once i had the soup base thickened i threw it all in the crockpot for several hours on low until the potatoes were totally cooked .	1
Wonderful recipe for people new to making soup. It's also an easy recipe to accomodate to your tastes. I'm a vegetarian so I took out the bacon. I also substituted vidalia onions for green onions and replaced the whole milk with skim. You can try soy bacon bits but I find they become soggy. Also try adding chopped potato skins (it has all the nutrients) to the soup to make it chunkier or add milk continuously to thin it out. Even though I now need a full membership to the local gym due to this soup it's worth it.

Thanks for posting such an easy recipe. I have made this twice and I've made the following changes.....I added a can of golden mushroom soup (plus a can of water) I substitued chives for green onions and I doubled the bacon. Delicioso! p.s. I have also made a lower-fat version using a combination of Butter and Olive Oil for the butter 1% milk for the whole milk and substituting canadian bacon for bacon. I also used 8 oz. fat free cream cheese and 2 cups of beef broth to substitute for sour cream and substituted laughing cow light cheese (3 triangles of the garlic/herb flavor) for the shredded cheddar......just as good and maybe better!!	thanks for posting such an easy recipe . i have made this twice and i 've made the following changes ... i added a can of golden mushroom soup -lrb- plus a can of water -rrb- i substitued chives for green onions and i doubled the bacon . delicioso ! p.s. i have also made a lower-fat version using a combination of butter and olive oil for the butter 1 % milk for the whole milk and substituting canadian bacon for bacon . i also used 8 oz . fat free cream cheese and 2 cups of beef broth to substitute for sour cream and substituted laughing cow light cheese -lrb- 3 triangles of the garlic/herb flavor -rrb- for the shredded cheddar ... just as good and maybe better !!	1
This soup is wonderful. I have tried many recipes but this one is JUST right. I reduced the fat a bit by using reduced fat sour cream using skim milk rather than whole milk reduced the cheddar cheese to about 6 ounces and only used 1/2 cup flour. It tasted just like restaurant potato soup.	this soup is wonderful . i have tried many recipes but this one is just right . i reduced the fat a bit by using reduced fat sour cream using skim milk rather than whole milk reduced the cheddar cheese to about 6 ounces and only used 1/2 cup flour . it tasted just like restaurant potato soup .	1

I made two batches of this recipe. One I made just as written and it was delicious! The second one I made exactly as written with one substitution: I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce in place of the butter. It too was absolutely delicious and the butter (and all those extra calories) was not missed one little bit. So I give this two thumbs up whichever way you choose to make it but I will be making it with the apple sauce to keep it healthy and light but just as delicious!! If you want to take this recipe uptown just a bit add some chopped walnuts - yum!!	i made two batches of this recipe . one i made just as written and it was delicious ! the second one i made exactly as written with one substitution : i used 1/2 cup of unsweetened apple sauce in place o f the butter . it too was absolutely delicious and the butter -lrb- and all those extra calories -rrb- was not missed one little bit . so i give this two thumbs up whichever way you choose to make it but i will b e making it with the apple sauce to keep it healthy and light but just as delicious !! if you want to take this recipe uptown just a bit add some chopped walnuts - yum !!	1

Made this last night exactly per the recipe. Read all the reviews and appreciated the hints. It is very good. Nice texture spongy consistency and good flavor. Since all my loaf recipes call for an hour of baking mine was in the oven for an hour and came out exactly like the picture - it raised to the top of the pan and didn't deflate. I chopped up the apples in my Pampered Chef chopper so my apple pieces were very small/tiny. I also folded the flour mixture into the creamed mixture with a spatula (not the electric mixture) added the milk as instructed and folded that in. As best as I can describe its doneness is when the cake part that seeps through the top is tan and has a dry look to it. I also learned that I should have left a margin of cake batter between the brown sugar mix and the cake pan otherwise if the brown sugar seeps out on the sides it turns very hard. Love this recipe.	made this last night exactly per the recipe . read all the reviews and appreciated the hints . it is very good . nice texture spongy consistency and good flavor . since all my loaf recipes call for an hou r of baking mine was in the oven for an hour and came out exactly like the picture - it raised to the top of the pan and did n't deflate . i chopped up the apples in my pampered chef chopper so my apple pieces were very small/tiny . i also folded the flour mixture into the creamed mixture with a spatula -lrb- not the electric mixture -rrb- added the milk as instructed and folded that in . as best as i can descr ibe its doneness is when the cake part that seeps through the top is tan and has a dry look to it . i also learned that i should have left a margin of cake batter between the brown sugar mix and the ca ke pan otherwise if the brown sugar seeps out on the sides it turns very hard . love this recipe .	1

This was very good and everybody liked it. One thing I would do differently next time is to toss the apples and cranberries together with the sugar etc. I usually pile my apples really high because they shrink when cooking - I couldn't do that and put the cranberries on top because the cranberries would roll off. So my pie ended up very thin. Delicious but more the thickness of a tart. With that one change this would be 5 stars. I do believe this will be making an appearance at the Thanksgiving dessert table.	this was very good and everybody liked it . one thing i would do differently next time is to toss the apples and cranberries together with the sugar etc. . i usually pile my apples really high because th ey shrink when cooking - i could n't do that and put the cranberries on top because the cranberries would roll off . so my pie ended up very thin . delicious but more the thickness of a tart . with that o ne change this would be 5 stars . i do believe this will be making an appearance at the thanksgiving dessert table .	1
This pie has a refreshing tartness that is usually absent from the Thanksgiving table. It's not fussy and very versatile. Last night instead of apples I thawed some peaches that we froze last August. I also added 1/4 tsp. of cloves. Like another reviewer I mixed the fruit sugar cornstarch and spices before adding to the pie. On a scale of 1 to 5 my husband gave it a 10.	this pie has a refreshing tartness that is usually absent from the thanksgiving table . it 's not fussy and very versatile . last night instead of apples i thawed some peaches that we froze last august . i also added 1/4 tsp . of cloves . like another reviewer i mixed the fruit sugar cornstarch and spices before adding to the pie . on a scale of 1 to 5 my husband gave it a 10 .	1
My DH and I loved this pie and I don't even like apple pie! The combination of the sweet and tart was spot on for us. I did make a change in the mixing of the ingredients. I folded the apples cranberries sugar cornstarch and cinnamon together before adding it to the crust. I also zested the peel from an orange that I had in the mix. Dotted the filling and added the top crust. I had Honey Crisp and Granny Smith apples so I used a mixture of both kinds. Wonderful served with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Great recipe however my cranberries were super tart so I ended up picking around most of them while eating this. Don't know if this is normal for cranberries. I know they're relatively tart anyways but mine just seemed way too sour. Some of them unbearably so. That said... I like the other reviewers mixed the apples sugar cornstarch and cranberries together. Just makes more sense to do it that way. Next time I make this I'll be changing the amount of cranberries to only a cup or maybe even just half a cup. Overall really good and everyone that tried it liked it. A nice variation on apple pie. And for those curious I used gala apples.	great recipe however my cranberries were super tart so i ended up picking around most of them while eating this . do n't know if this is normal for cranberries . i know they 're relatively tart anyways bu t mine just seemed way too sour . some of them unbearably so . that said ... i like the other reviewers mixed the apples sugar cornstarch and cranberries together . just makes more sense to do it that way . next time i make this i 'll be changing the amount of cranberries to only a cup or maybe even just half a cup . overall really good and everyone that tried it liked it . a nice variation on apple pie . and for those curious i used gala apples .	1

As someone else suggested I tossed the berries and apples with the sugar spice and cornstarch. I also added some extra cinnamon a bit of nutmeg and a dash of clove to jazz it up. I also used only 2 medium Granny Smiths which would be about half the apples called for but the sugar was just right. I don't like my sweets as sweet as some people do and cranberries should be tart!

The cranberries were WAY too tart. They were completely inedible. I don't know if adding more sugar would help? I took the advice of one of the reviewers and mixed the apples and cranberries with the sugar mixture in a bowl first before putting it into the pie. So maybe that was where I went wrong. Maybe if you place the apples then cranberries then the sugar mixture on top the cranberries get most of the sugar? I don't know. But I probably will not make this again.	the cranberries were way too tart . they were completely inedible . i do n't know if adding more sugar would help ? i took the advice of one of the reviewers and mixed the apples and cranberries with the sugar mixture in a bowl first before putting it into the pie . so maybe that was where i went wrong . maybe if you place the apples then cranberries then the sugar mixture on top the cranberries get mos t of the sugar ? i do n't know . but i probably will not make this again .	1
This stuffing is incredible! Instead of leeks I used 4 cups of chopped onion. I also used Bob Evans Pork Sausage instead of sweet italian sausage. This was so moist and full of flavor. It made enough to stuff the turkey and fill a baking dish. It's worth the preparation and I'll definitely be making this again next year.	this stuffing is incredible ! instead of leeks i used 4 cups of chopped onion . i also used bob evans pork sausage instead of sweet italian sausage . this was so moist and full of flavor . it made enough to stuff the turkey and fill a baking dish . it 's worth the preparation and i 'll definitely be making this again next year .	1
Excellent easy and delicious. I did use the leeks - and three large leeks measured out to the 6 cups. I was worried about the large amount of leeks in the recipe but they were an excellent addition to the recipe and cooked down considerably. I did use turkey sausage as the recipe submittor suggested. I also used dried cherries instead of cranberries. About 3/4s of a 1-pound loaf of white bread produced 12 cups of bread cubes called for in the recipe which I toasted briefly in my oven as it preheated. This looked elegant on the table - very impressive. I baked it alone rather than stuffing my bird so I used just a bit extra chicken broth.	excellent easy and delicious . i did use the leeks - and three large leeks measured out to the 6 cups . i was worried about the large amount of leeks in the recipe but they were an excellent addition to the recipe and cooked down considerably . i did use turkey sausage as the recipe submittor suggested . i also used dried cherries instead of cranberries . about 3/4 s of a 1 pound loaf of white bread pro duced 12 cups of bread cubes called for in the recipe which i toasted briefly in my oven as it preheated . this looked elegant on the table - very impressive . i baked it alone rather than stuffing my b ird so i used just a bit extra chicken broth .	1
I got lots of great feedback on this stuffing. I made it to take to my daughter's Thanksgiving feast at school this week. I used 4 cups of onions instead of the leeks. It seemed like an awful lot of onion but once it was cooked it tasted great. Because the feast was at lunch time I made this the night before and heated it the next day. If anything I think it improved the flavor because it all had time to meld together. Just remember to factor in extra baking time if you do this. It really took quite a while for all that cold stuffing to heat up. However it would be nice to be able to make this the night before Thanksgiving and just heat it up on Thanksgiving leaving more time for all those other dishes that need your attention.	i got lots of great feedback on this stuffing . i made it to take to my daughter 's thanksgiving feast at school this week . i used 4 cups of onions instead of the leeks . it seemed like an awful lot of o nion but once it was cooked it tasted great . because the feast was at lunch time i made this the night before and heated it the next day . if anything i think it improved the flavor because it all had time to meld together . just remember to factor in extra baking time if you do this . it really took quite a while for all that cold stuffing to heat up . however it would be nice to be able to make this the night before thanksgiving and just heat it up on thanksgiving leaving more time for all those other dishes that need your attention .	1
We have served this several years in a row and LOVE it. I do alter it a smidge by adding a little more chicken broth at the end (which I believe the directions forgot to tell you to add in the first place but it is in the ingredient list.) Instead of 1 1/3 cups I add 2 cups. This year I made it with sourdough bread and it turned out divine.	we have served this several years in a row and love it . i do alter it a smidge by adding a little more chicken broth at the end -lrb- which i believe the directions forgot to tell you to add in the first p lace but it is in the ingredient list . -rrb- instead of 1 1/3 cups i add 2 cups . this year i made it with sourdough bread and it turned out divine .	1

Hubs and I loved these! It's such a treat when I find a recipe that truly stands out from the ordinary! I found the tiniest Yukon potatoes which were particularly attractive on the plate. The recipe is just perfect as is although the next time I make these I might try a little more horseradish for just a bit more kick. For presentation and a bit of color I sprinkled some finely chopped parsley over the top but fresh minced chives would be equally good.

These little potatoes took FOREVER to bake and my sauce ended up burning. So once they were just about done I transferred the potatoes to a new dish and remade the sauce and put them back into the oven. Next time I'll definitely take the advice of other reviewers and cook them in the microwave first and then the oven. The end result however was wonderful.

Wonderful.  The flavor is very unique.  Use real butter - margarine doesn't taste as good.  Recipe says you can just make the sauce and pour over cooked potatoes, but I wouldn't recommend it.  The sauce really needs the hour in the oven for the flavors of the horseradish and lemon to soften and blend.

A refreshingly different salad. I used raspberries instead of strawberries. The sweetness of the raspberries went well with the mild taste of the dressing.

REDUCED FAT VERSION Great flavors that work well together. The dressing is awesome but I always look at how can I cut the fat or calories and maintain the full flavor or even bump it a bit. I did this recipe just as described but I swapped out the milk for fat free half and half and added just a dash of water. I also used Mayo which is Olive oil based (Green lid by major brand) cutting all the saturated fat and cutting down on the non-saturated by about half. Last thing I did was to zest the lime with a micro-plane making the finest zest possible and added it to the dressing. Hope that helps for those of us who try to cut out as much fat as possible!	reduced fat version great flavors that work well together . the dressing is awesome but i always look at how can i cut the fat or calories and maintain the full flavor or even bump it a bit . i did this recipe just as described but i swapped out the milk for fat free half and half and added just a dash of water . i also used mayo which is olive oil based -lrb- green lid by major brand -rrb- cutting all the sat urated fat and cutting down on the non-saturated by about half . last thing i did was to zest the lime with a micro-plane making the finest zest possible and added it to the dressing . hope that helps f or those of us who try to cut out as much fat as possible !	1

A very nice very tasty salad. I have made it several times now. Thanks it will turn into one of our regulars. I add about 1/8 of a teaspoon of Ancho Chili powder to the dressing which gives the dressing a little more fullness in flavor. Sometimes I fry up cod in butter with salt pepper fresh garlic and ginger as an accompaniment rather than chicken. It doesn't cube well but the flavors are very complimentary.	a very nice very tasty salad . i have made it several times now . thanks it will turn into one of our regulars . i add about 1/8 of a teaspoon of ancho chili powder to the dressing which gives the dressi ng a little more fullness in flavor . sometimes i fry up cod in butter with salt pepper fresh garlic and ginger as an accompaniment rather than chicken . it does n't cube well but the flavors are very co mplimentary .	1

So tasty, so easy, so great!!  I've made this three times (for a houseful of company each time), and it's always a hit. (It's also really nice to be able to visit in the morning instead of standing at the stove.) These are generous servings, and thank goodness - everyone goes for seconds!  I've tried the half regular/half sage sausage combo as suggested, but my favorite is to just use Jimmy Dean Maple flavor sausage - HEAVENLY.

This is wonderful on a cold December morning especially at Christmas. The bread does not have to be toasted or cut up. You can just cut the crusts off and make one layer on the bottom of the baking dish and pour the egg mixture over it. I sometimes saute chopped onion with the sausage also have added mushrooms. I always serve with side of picante and sour cream but not necessary.	this is wonderful on a cold december morning especially at christmas . the bread does not have to be toasted or cut up . you can just cut the crusts off and make one layer on the bottom of the baking di sh and pour the egg mixture over it . i sometimes saute chopped onion with the sausage also have added mushrooms . i always serve with side of picante and sour cream but not necessary .	1
I prepared this Christmas eve with a few changes from others. I made this with 6 eggs maple sausage. I used 1/2 cup croutons & 6 slices of toated bread.

A huge hit on Christmas morning and special brunches at our house! Very hearty and works just as well with 12 ounces of the reduced fat sausage in place of the pound of regular sausage. Be sure to0 LET IT SET OVERNIGHT!!!! Once we were pressed for time and we just mixed it and popped it in the oven and it was mush! Follow the directions and you will love this! Try extra sharp cheddar too!	a huge hit on christmas morning and special brunches at our house ! very hearty and works just as well with 12 ounces of the reduced fat sausage in place of the pound of regular sausage . be sure to0 le t it set overnight !!!! once we were pressed for time and we just mixed it and popped it in the oven and it was mush ! follow the directions and you will love this ! try extra sharp cheddar too !	1
Good recipe.  One addition I tried last weekend was to use hash browns instead of bread.  Really folks, it was amazing and took it to the next level.  Give it a try!

This is my recipe, I now use 1 pound of bacon, crumbled, a bag of frozen baby broccoli florets (no need to defrost), and 2-4 cups of cheese, the rest of the recipe is the same, it makes it better.

Despite me overcooking the potatoes this was still very good. Being vegetarian I left out the bacon and I also substituted red pepper for green pickled jalapenos for fresh (can't get fresh ones easily here) and Dijon mustard for brown mustard (don't know what that is).

A very good and easy soup. I used a large baking potato so the soup was nice and thick after blending. Also I didn't add the thawed broccoli until the potato was already tender and just cooked it a few minutes more so that the broccoli kept a nice green color and fresh flavor. My family including my 9-yr. old son really liked this soup.	a very good and easy soup . i used a large baking potato so the soup was nice and thick after blending . also i did n't add the thawed broccoli until the potato was already tender and just cooked it a fe w minutes more so that the broccoli kept a nice green color and fresh flavor . my family including my 9 yr . old son really liked this soup .	1
I was worried after reading other reviews of this recipe but gave it a try anyhow because it looked so easy. It turned out terrific!! It was a little bland but I just added some chopped fresh sage and a little season salt and it turned out great! And you can't beat it for healthy. For my husband I stirred a 1/4 c of chopped proscuitto (you could use ham too) into his and he loved it. I also doubled the potato as per previous reviews here and I loved the thick texture. I will definitely put this in our monthly rotation - thanks Lon!	i was worried after reading other reviews of this recipe but gave it a try anyhow because it looked so easy . it turned out terrific !! it was a little bland but i just added some chopped fresh sage and a little season salt and it turned out great ! and you ca n't beat it for healthy . for my husband i stirred a 1/4 c of chopped proscuitto -lrb- you could use ham too -rrb- into his and he loved it . i also double d the potato as per previous reviews here and i loved the thick texture . i will definitely put this in our monthly rotation - thanks lon !	1
This recipe rocks especially if you're obsessed with soup like I am! It's totally easy and totally tweakable. I used fresh broccoli two small red potatoes with the skins on and omitted the nutmeg (had none in the house). I also threw some reduced-fat white cheddar cheese in the bowl and it got all melty and delicious and tasted as good as the Panera broccoli cheddar I love but can no longer eat because it's awful for you. But even with the cheese this recipe is low-cal.

Fabulous Broccoli Soup! I too used fresh broccoli omitted the nutmeg and added red pepper flakes to give it some kick. Really adds to the flavor. I also used evaporated skim milk to make it creamier but the potato pretty much does that on its own.

After reading some great & some not so great reviews I decided to give this soup a try even though my first impression of the ingredients did not appeal to me. Should have stuck with my first impression because I found it very bland and watery. I used fresh broccoli which may have affected it some and left out the nutmeg. After doctoring it up with some cream cheddar cheese and butter and also thickening it with some flour it was much better. This one is not a keeper for me.	after reading some great & some not so great reviews i decided to give this soup a try even though my first impression of the ingredients did not appeal to me . should have stuck with my first impressi on because i found it very bland and watery . i used fresh broccoli which may have affected it some and left out the nutmeg . after doctoring it up with some cream cheddar cheese and butter and also thi ckening it with some flour it was much better . this one is not a keeper for me .	1

I don't think I ever knew real stuffed pepper love until I met these.  Wow.  Other than using red bell peppers I didn't change a thing.  Confusion over when to add the cheese, in the mixture or as a topping, or 1/2 and 1/2.  I added it to the mixture and it was very noticeable and worked out well there.  It would've been difficult to sprinkle on top as there was a LOT of stuffing, so much I piled it as high as I could on each pepper.  Not cooking the meat first seemed stranged to me, but I think this method adds to the flavor and everything cooked to perfect doneness in the time frame given.  Spoon the sauce from the pan on afterwards for flavor and to make it look even tastier.  If you think is good the first night, it's double WOW reheated the next day.	i do n't think i ever knew real stuffed pepper love until i met these . wow . other than using red bell peppers i did n't change a thing . confusion over when to add the cheese , in the mixture or as a t opping , or 1/2 and 1/2 . i added it to the mixture and it was very noticeable and worked out well there . it would 've been difficult to sprinkle on top as there was a lot of stuffing , so much i piled it as high as i could on each pepper . not cooking the meat first seemed stranged to me , but i think this method adds to the flavor and everything cooked to perfect doneness in the time frame given . spoon the sauce from the pan on afterwards for flavor and to make it look even tastier . if you think is good the first night , it 's double wow reheated the next day .	1
I thought this recipe was great.  My family was only so-so about it but they don't care for stuffed peppers at all.  The only complaint I have about the recipe is that made as is, you have way too much filling or not enough peppers.  I used 4 very large bell peppers and still had a ton of filling left over.  I even over over stuffed mine and had extra.  I could have easily stuffed 3-4 more peppers with the filling.  I just cooked the extra filling along with the peppers in the sauce.  Thank you for a very flavorful new spin on the old stuffed pepper!	i thought this recipe was great . my family was only so-so about it but they do n't care for stuffed peppers at all . the only complaint i have about the recipe is that made as is , you have way too muc h filling or not enough peppers . i used 4 very large bell peppers and still had a ton of filling left over . i even over over stuffed mine and had extra . i could have easily stuffed 3 - 4 more peppers with the filling . i just cooked the extra filling along with the peppers in the sauce . thank you for a very flavorful new spin on the old stuffed pepper !	1
Sooooo good sooooo easy & 5 stars all the way. I used light sour cream and Splenda blend and it still was delicious. The pie crust is done in seconds in the food processor is tender and you don't even have to roll it out just press into the pie dish. Absolutely wouldn't change a thing; it's perfect as is.	sooooo good sooooo easy & 5 stars all the way . i used light sour cream and splenda blend and it still was delicious . the pie crust is done in seconds in the food processor is tender and you do n't even have to roll it out just press into the pie dish . absolutely would n't change a thing ; it 's perfect as is .	1
This is my absolute favorite recipe. I'm not a huge pie person but this is definitely the exception to the rule. I can't stop eating it! The pie crust is flakey and buttery and the pie is the perfect balance of tart and sweetness. Although the recipe is simple and easy to make you can tell after the first bite that every ingredient s main purpose is to highlight the natural flavors of the peaches. They key here is to use fresh ripe peaches! Don't use canned or frozen and don't use skim sour cream... there's a reason for each ingredient. If you absolutely must add your own flare I suggest spices such as cinnamon nutmeg etc... but I insist you try it at least once as is you won't be disappointed!	this is my absolute favorite recipe . i 'm not a huge pie person but this is definitely the exception to the rule . i ca n't stop eating it ! the pie crust is flakey and buttery and the pie is the perfect balance of tart and sweetness . although the recipe is simple and easy to make you can tell after the first bite that every ingredient s main purpose is to highlight the natural flavors of the peaches . they key here is to use fresh ripe peaches ! do n't use canned or frozen and do n't use skim sour cream ... there 's a reason for each ingredient . if you absolutely must add your own flare i suggest spice s such as cinnamon nutmeg etc. . . but i insist you try it at least once as is you wo n't be disappointed !	1
I think this may be my first time rating a recipe after several years of getting great recipes from this site. I have to tell you though.... This pie is WONDERFUL! Don't forget to try with vanilla ice cream - yummy! Sounds really strange to put sour cream in a peach pie but it works beautifully. I fully intended to give half of it away but my husband wouldn't let me. I can't believe we ate the whole thing! I'm making it again this weekend for 4th of July and I'm certain it will become a Thanksgiving staple. We had hundreds of peaches from a tree in the back yard; Thanks to gent500 for the great recipe.

I'm not a pie maker but I loved this recipe. I've made it three times now. I finally switched from flour to cornstarch for the filling which kept coming out runny. Also tried mixing 1-2 tablespoons if cornstarch into peaches after I cut them into smaller bite size pieces. Also have used filling in a prepared pie crust..hubby loves it.	i 'm not a pie maker but i loved this recipe . i 've made it three times now . i finally switched from flour to cornstarch for the filling which kept coming out runny . also tried mixing 1 - 2 tablespoons if cornstarch into peaches after i cut them into smaller bite size pieces . also have used filling in a prepared pie crust . . hubby loves it .	1

Subsituted with fat free sour cream and doing exactly as directions pie never cooked to firmness..I baked literally for 2 1/2 hrs even used speed bake for last half hour. Still was soggy inside. But It did have a great taste.

This is my pancake recipe now. However I do not use butter. I substitute 1/4c canola oil (or sometimes unsweetened applesauce. If I double I use 1/4c each). I also use 1 egg and 2 egg whites instead of 3 eggs. Since I don't usually have buttermilk I use soured milk (add tbs lemon juice or vinegar to your milk). I gradually add the liquid until the batter is the right consistency since it tends to be thin. I throw in a tbs or two of ground flax seed for a little added nutrition. I usually double this recipe and freeze the extras. They warm up great in the toaster. They're also great if you add blueberries.	this is my pancake recipe now . however i do not use butter . i substitute 1/4 c canola oil -lrb- or sometimes unsweetened applesauce . if i double i use 1/4 c each -rrb- . i also use 1 egg and 2 egg whites instead o f 3 eggs . since i do n't usually have buttermilk i use soured milk -lrb- add tbs lemon juice or vinegar to your milk -rrb- . i gradually add the liquid until the batter is the right consistency since it tends to be thin . i throw in a tbs or two of ground flax seed for a little added nutrition . i usually double this recipe and freeze the extras . they warm up great in the toaster . they 're also great if you add blueberries .	1
I used the lemon juice/1% milk substitution for buttermilk (1 tablespoon lemon juice for each cup of milk). I also substituted cinnamon applesauce for butter.

"Jen thanks for the great recipe! The pancakes turned out fluffy and light just as advertised! I didn't measure any of the ingredients directly (I ususlly go by 'feel' when cooking). Because of this I wasn't too concerned about the fact that baking soda was missing from the ingredients list but was called for in the body of the recipe... If you want to make this recipe and you are going to use buttermilk do not forget to use the baking soda! I think I put about a 3/4"" of a teaspoon in. I also didn't have any buttermilk but I found that if you put about 2tsp of regular vinegar in whole or 2% milk it will cause the milk to curdle slightly and will closely resemble buttermilk. (By the way you can't even begin to taste the vinegar in the final pancakes after baking.) I've added this recipe to my box and will now make it my mainstay for making pancakes!"	jen thanks for the great recipe ! the pancakes turned out fluffy and light just as advertised ! i did n't measure any of the ingredients directly -lrb- i ususlly go by ` feel ' when cooking -rrb- . because of this i was n't too concerned about the fact that baking soda was missing from the ingredients list but was called for in the body of the recipe ... if you want to make this recipe and you are going to use butt ermilk do not forget to use the baking soda ! i think i put about a 3/4 '' of a teaspoon in . i also did n't have any buttermilk but i found that if you put about 2 tsp of regular vinegar in whole or 2 % mil k it will cause the milk to curdle slightly and will closely resemble buttermilk . -lrb- by the way you ca n't even begin to taste the vinegar in the final pancakes after baking . -rrb- i 've added this recipe to m y box and will now make it my mainstay for making pancakes !	1
I made these pancakes for Easter breakfast and everyone loved them! My father-in-law could not stop eating them. I did change the recipe a little....gound up in my coffee grinder a little flaxseed wheat bulgar and wheat germ and used it in place of the white flour and then through in a small handfull of the whole flaxseed and bulgar for a little crunch. I also went light on the buttermilk and added a teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla..... best pancakes I have ever had....and by the way froze the leftovers and popped them in the toaster...came our great!	i made these pancakes for easter breakfast and everyone loved them ! my father-in-law could not stop eating them . i did change the recipe a little ... gound up in my coffee grinder a little flaxseed whe at bulgar and wheat germ and used it in place of the white flour and then through in a small handfull of the whole flaxseed and bulgar for a little crunch . i also went light on the buttermilk and adde d a teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla ... . best pancakes i have ever had ... and by the way froze the leftovers and popped them in the toaster ... came our great !	1
I found out that if you use a pastry brush to brush oil onto the pan in the shape of any alphabet the impression gets onto the pancake when done. Amazing!The recipe is great eventhough i made a few alterations like using whole wheat flour baking powder salt in the ratio of 2 cups: 1 tablespoon: 1teaspoon & lesser sugar.I used the butter milk but avoided the butter in the batter.	i found out that if you use a pastry brush to brush oil onto the pan in the shape of any alphabet the impression gets onto the pancake when done . amazing!the recipe is great eventhough i made a few al terations like using whole wheat flour baking powder salt in the ratio of 2 cups : 1 tablespoon : 1 teaspoon & lesser sugar.i used the butter milk but avoided the butter in the batter .	1
I made these for my husband's birthday yesterday and they turned out great. I didn't have buttermilk so I used 1/2 vanilla yoghurt and 1/2 skim milk (healthier that way too). I added blueberries to some pancakes chocolate chips to some and nothing to the others and they were all yummy! I was a little concerned though about the amount of butter. I think next time I'll try to cut down the butter and sub some applesauce instead.

This was the first time I made pancakes from scratch (I always use the boxed Bisquick powder). I wanted to try a recipe that tasted more like restaurant pancakes. The batter is quite thick and I found they were harder to flip being so heavy. All of the butter made them greasier than I like but the butter flavor was very good. I sprayed my griddle with cooking spray knowing these already had so much butter. I followed the recipe exactly although my son wanted chocolate chips in his and I used white whole wheat flour. My son wasn't crazy about these at all. I liked the flavor but they were just too greasy and dense. I do think these could be great with some changes though. I am going to experiment with canola oil and applesauce next time and just put a little butter on top of the finished pancake for flavor. I will also substitute some of the buttermilk for skim milk and see if this helps. If you want a very filling pancake these will really stick by you and I love the use of whole wheat flour and wheat germ.	this was the first time i made pancakes from scratch -lrb- i always use the boxed bisquick powder -rrb- . i wanted to try a recipe that tasted more like restaurant pancakes . the batter is quite thick and i found they were harder to flip being so heavy . all of the butter made them greasier than i like but the butter flavor was very good . i sprayed my griddle with cooking spray knowing these already had so muc h butter . i followed the recipe exactly although my son wanted chocolate chips in his and i used white whole wheat flour . my son was n't crazy about these at all . i liked the flavor but they were just too greasy and dense . i do think these could be great with some changes though . i am going to experiment with canola oil and applesauce next time and just put a little butter on top of the finished pa ncake for flavor . i will also substitute some of the buttermilk for skim milk and see if this helps . if you want a very filling pancake these will really stick by you and i love the use of whole wheat flour and wheat germ .	1

Excellent base recipe. I made a few modifications and this came out superb! First off instead of steaming the broccoli in a steamer I added it to a saute pan with a little bit of water (maybe a 1/2 cup) a tablespoon of butter and some minced garlic. When I sauteed the mushrooms I added a little bit of fresh spinach (about 2 cups/handfuls). I also added a few pinches of Marjoram Basil Thyme and parsley paste (in substitute for fresh parsley). Instead of putting the dry mustard in the dough I added it to the cream mixture since I bought a pre-made crust. When it came time to add the egg I added one extra to equal four. Turned out fantastic! One of the best recipes I've used from this site in a while!

I've made this a few times and it's a family favorite.  It tastes sooo good.  I modified the recipe only slightly.  For the crust I used 1/4 tsp. salt instead of 1/2 tsp.  I thought it was too salty.  Also for the filling, I substituted light cream for the half-and-half, and added a dash of pepper.	i 've made this a few times and it 's a family favorite . it tastes sooo good . i modified the recipe only slightly . for the crust i used 1/4 tsp . salt instead of 1/2 tsp . i thought it was too salty . also for the filling , i substituted light cream for the half-and-half , and added a dash of pepper .	1
This was a yummy way to use the broccoli from my garden and the eggs from my sister's chickens! I do agree however that the crust seemed salty -- I will reduce it by half the next time I make it. But overall it was really good and different from just a plain old quiche.	this was a yummy way to use the broccoli from my garden and the eggs from my sister 's chickens ! i do agree however that the crust seemed salty -- i will reduce it by half the next time i make it . but overall it was really good and different from just a plain old quiche .	1
This was good and my husband liked it. I didn't have chedder substituted colby-jack instead. The crust didn't taste real cheesy but very rich. I cooked the onions in the microwave to reduce dirty dishes. I did not add mushrooms -my husband dislikes- but added the last of some turkey bacon. I also added 2% milk instead of cream which was fine. Could have used a touch more salt or seasoning in the eggs. I will make this again though.	this was good and my husband liked it . i did n't have chedder substituted colby-jack instead . the crust did n't taste real cheesy but very rich . i cooked the onions in the microwave to reduce dirty dish es . i did not add mushrooms - my husband dislikes - but added the last of some turkey bacon . i also added 2 % milk instead of cream which was fine . could have used a touch more salt or seasoning in the e ggs . i will make this again though .	1

Fantastic! My only variations are to use 8 large chicken thighs (skin on to reduce prep and cleanup time) substitute a dry red wine for the water and use 1 cup of Barilla Marinara for the tomato sauce. NOTE: after browning all the thighs it s a good idea to drain most of the fat before proceeding. I serve over buttered wide egg noodles.	fantastic ! my only variations are to use 8 large chicken thighs -lrb- skin on to reduce prep and cleanup time -rrb- substitute a dry red wine for the water and use 1 cup of barilla marinara for the tomato sauce . note : after browning all the thighs it s a good idea to drain most of the fat before proceeding . i serve over buttered wide egg noodles .	1
Pretty much followed the recipe as is. The only difference was that I seasoned the chicken with Italian seasoning before browning and doubled the tomato sauce. Other than that this came out so yummy and it was so quick and easy to do! Definitely a keeper!

Very good! Used my homemade sauce. I always make a big batch & freeze it in 2 cup batches so I'm always ready when I get the urge to cook. I too spiced it up a little more. Had 2 zucchini that were just about ready for zucchini heaven so I threw them in too slced of course. I have a new electric pressure cooker so next time I'll make this in my P.C. and let you all know how it turns out.	very good ! used my homemade sauce . i always make a big batch & freeze it in 2 cup batches so i 'm always ready when i get the urge to cook . i too spiced it up a little more . had 2 zucchini that were ju st about ready for zucchini heaven so i threw them in too slced of course . i have a new electric pressure cooker so next time i 'll make this in my p.c. and let you all know how it turns out .	1
I made this as written except I used chicken thighs. In the video, I thought he said to keep all the chicken run-off after browning. I wish I would have stuck with my mind and drained it. The meal was so greasy I couldn't taste anything else. If you make this with thighs, PLEASE drain it before putting everything else in. It was a waste of food in my house.	i made this as written except i used chicken thighs . in the video , i thought he said to keep all the chicken run-off after browning . i wish i would have stuck with my mind and drained it . the meal was so greasy i could n't taste anything else . if you make this with thighs , please drain it before putting everything else in . it was a waste of food in my house .	1
Very pleased with this recipe. I had thighs and drumsticks skipped the oregano and used seasoned salt. I also added zucchini as another reviewer suggested. I used chicken broth instead of water.I cooked in my cassoulet and it came out great. We had with some fluffily rice. I have made this three times now.

UUUMMMM!!! That was probably the best variation of macaroni salad I have tried. I excluded the chicken because I was serving it with a meal and didn't think I needed it but it would be a great meal on its own with the chicken. Definitely heed the advice about letting it sit overnight though. I had to test when it was first made and have to say I was not impressed but once it sat yummy!	uuummmm !!! that was probably the best variation of macaroni salad i have tried . i excluded the chicken because i was serving it with a meal and did n't think i needed it but it would be a great meal on its own with the chicken . definitely heed the advice about letting it sit overnight though . i had to test when it was first made and have to say i was not impressed but once it sat yummy !	1
Big name but great taste! I doubled the recipe using 1/2 c mayo and sour cream while still just using 1 pkt of ranch dressing. Also I grilled a few chicken breasts vs canned and worked great!

Thanks for everyones great reviews. I have since tried this recipe and instead of using canned chicken I used Rotisserie chicken that I shredded up from the grocery store and used black olives instead of green and added bacon. It is soooo delicious. There are so many variations to this recipe.

Yummy recipe! I used 1/2 the celery because my hubby isn't a big celery fan and I opted for baked chunks of chicken instead of the canned.I had him try it cold - and then he heated it up in the microwave just to see how it was warmed. He gave it a thumbs up either way. I will definately make it again! I'm going to add pimentos for a little more color next time and I plan on trying it with tuna instead of chicken sometime.

I made a few changes but really liked this salad. I used small shells instead of elbow macaroni. I also added a couple of chopped green onions. Used leftover chopped turkey instead of canned chicken. Because I found it a little too salty initially I increased the turkey to 2 cups and added 2 diced hard-boiled eggs and that seemed to take care of it. Served it on a bed of lettuce with cherry tomatoes as a garnish.

I changed a few things... use apples instead of pears as that was all I had, used Jack Daniels instead of Irish Whiskey, walnuts instead of hazelnuts and used chicken boullion instead of just water. I also tripled the whiskey amount, as my husband and I both love the taste of whiskey and the dish was not overpoweringly whiskey tasting. It was perfect! Absolutely will make again, especially in the fall.	i changed a few things ... use apples instead of pears as that was all i had , used jack daniels instead of irish whiskey , walnuts instead of hazelnuts and used chicken boullion instead of just water . i also tripled the whiskey amount , as my husband and i both love the taste of whiskey and the dish was not overpoweringly whiskey tasting . it was perfect ! absolutely will make again , especially in the fall .	1
"Made this tonight on a whim to use some sweet potatoes I had. I used some drumsticks instead just because I had them and it was great. 

 It was delicious! I would however make a few adjustments next time. I loved the pears and would add another. I would also double the spinach, since it cooks down so much.

I hate when people rate recipes after they've altered it, but I'm sure the original is just as good, if not better, than the version I made.  Based on what I had on hand, I used granny smith apples instead of pears, omitted the whiskey, and used toasted almonds instead of hazelnuts.  It was delicious!  Next time I will make it as written to see which version is better, but I'll leave the chicken out because I don't think it adds anything.	i hate when people rate recipes after they 've altered it , but i 'm sure the original is just as good , if not better , than the version i made . based on what i had on hand , i used granny smith apples in stead of pears , omitted the whiskey , and used toasted almonds instead of hazelnuts . it was delicious ! next time i will make it as written to see which version is better , but i 'll leave the chicken o ut because i do n't think it adds anything .	1

This recipe was delicious and a good way of getting a lot of healthy items into my hubbys diet in one dish.

Good flavors but I felt like it was missing some depth. I'll add more whiskey next time and maybe chicken stock instead of water. Wait on adding the pears until just before serving or they start to break down.	good flavors but i felt like it was missing some depth . i 'll add more whiskey next time and maybe chicken stock instead of water . wait on adding the pears until just before serving or they start to br eak down .	1
Tastes like a hash with sweet potatoes rather mushy and spinachy... Don't like sweet potato and spinach combo....just my opinion.

This was good and close to authentic jerk flavor. I used habaneros as written but think it would be better with scotch bonnet peppers. Served with simple baked sweet potatoes topped with butter salt and pepper and a classic carrot-pineapple raisin salad with a pineapple-maple vinaigrette. Our pork cooked up just a tiny bit dry (we normally grill the tenderloin whole) so I spooned a bit of the vinaigrette over it.

I made this recipe last summer and everyone loved it however hubby wanted it to have more flavor. So last weekend when whole pork loins were on sale I bought one and put it in my slow cooker with the marinade. The house smelled so good. When I was ready to serve I pulled it apart some but not completely. Served with beans and rice and everyone raved how good it was. Best of all it looked and tasted just like the jerk pork hubby gets at his favorite restaurant.

I am very much a beginner cook just retired husband. This will be one of my keeper recipes though.

After reading this recipe I went to the store bought the ingredients and made it the same day. My husband and I loved it. I modified the recipe slightly with more garlic (two cloves which was a little too much even for us garlic lovers)and half whipping cream and half milk. I think I would have liked a little more salt. Also this is a great elegant side dish for a company meal.	after reading this recipe i went to the store bought the ingredients and made it the same day . my husband and i loved it . i modified the recipe slightly with more garlic -lrb- two cloves which was a little too much even for us garlic lovers -rrb- and half whipping cream and half milk . i think i would have liked a little more salt . also this is a great elegant side dish for a company meal .	1

Not sure what happened we've made souffles before. But this one fell drastically and the texture wasn't right - kind of mushy. We tried baking one longer but that didn't firm it up. The flavor wasn't good either - very bland should have added salt and more garlic. The egg and asparagus didn't complement each other at all. Won't try this again.	not sure what happened we 've made souffles before . but this one fell drastically and the texture was n't right - kind of mushy . we tried baking one longer but that did n't firm it up . the flavor was n't good either - very bland should have added salt and more garlic . the egg and asparagus did n't complement each other at all . wo n't try this again .	1
I was very much looking forward to trying this recipe for me but to my surprise my hubby instantly fell in love with this and he doesn't even like bell peppers of any color. First bite in and he was praising it like he has only done a few others from this site. Don't get me wrong he enjoys many from here but this one really stood out to him to the point he was talking about it the rest of the night and already asking when we would have it again. This recipe is great hot or cold and I agree with him in the fact it should be part of our regular rotation. I added green onion to the top because we like it so much and it was good but not necessary. All of the flavors blend splendidly with one another in this and I wouldn't change a thing.

This was a very delicious recipe! I made it exactly as written. I would suggest that for the amount of dressing I would use a scant cup of orzo or even a little less because it did need a little more dressing. A little garlic in the dressing would have worked well too. Serving it in the pepper was a nice idea but totally not necessary. Actually I might even just dice up a quarter of the pepper and add it to the salad. It just depends on your presentation. I was thinking that adding a quarter cup of toasted pine nuts would have been perfect with this! You can see that this is a versatile idea that will become part of your cooking repertoire. Thanks for posting geranium! UPDATE: I microwaved the little bit of the leftover pasta the next night and it was delicious served warm too!	this was a very delicious recipe ! i made it exactly as written . i would suggest that for the amount of dressing i would use a scant cup of orzo or even a little less because it did need a little more dressing . a little garlic in the dressing would have worked well too . serving it in the pepper was a nice idea but totally not necessary . actually i might even just dice up a quarter of the pepper and add it to the salad . it just depends on your presentation . i was thinking that adding a quarter cup of toasted pine nuts would have been perfect with this ! you can see that this is a versatile idea t hat will become part of your cooking repertoire . thanks for posting geranium ! update : i microwaved the little bit of the leftover pasta the next night and it was delicious served warm too !	1

This was great for a hot summer super. I used the breast meat from a store bought roasted chicken and kalamata olives. I added a half of a large cucumber seeded and chopped and 4 green onions sliced very thin. The flavors were great and the dressing was just the right amount--not too heavy but flavorful enough to know it was there. This will be a summer staple.	this was great for a hot summer super . i used the breast meat from a store bought roasted chicken and kalamata olives . i added a half of a large cucumber seeded and chopped and 4 green onions sliced v ery thin . the flavors were great and the dressing was just the right amount -- not too heavy but flavorful enough to know it was there . this will be a summer staple .	1

Hi all I just made this & it's in the fridge cooling. I didn't want the chicken just wanted a nice side dish. I won't serve in the pepper cups though its a nice presentation for sure. I didnt have tomatoes so I used 1/2 can of diced with jalapenos instead but would be better with fresh I know. When I made the dressing I just added 3/4 tsp Italian seasoning instead of basil & oregano & a dash of lemon juice. My husband who didn't understand what a Orzo salad was just said mmmm when I gave him a sample:-)	hi all i just made this & it 's in the fridge cooling . i did n't want the chicken just wanted a nice side dish . i wo n't serve in the pepper cups though its a nice presentation for sure . i didnt have tom atoes so i used 1/2 can of diced with jalapenos instead but would be better with fresh i know . when i made the dressing i just added 3/4 tsp italian seasoning instead of basil & oregano & a dash of le mon juice . my husband who did n't understand what a orzo salad was just said mmmm when i gave him a sample :--rrb-	1

I really wanted to love this but it turned out the dijon was too powerful for me taking over the great flavors of the other ingredients. I knew it was risky for me not liking Dijon but my husband loves dijon so I knew it work out -- he thought it was great.

I used arugula rather than spinach (I had everything else on hand) and that was the only major change I made. The olive oil I used was lemon olive oil and I used leftover beer butt chicken rather than grilled. I toasted the pine nuts (put them in a pan on stovetop in low heat until barely browned). We thought this was delicious. The only thing I would worry about would be that there wasn't enough of that wonderful dressing. I'm not sure because I made such a small batch and we didn't even eat all of that but I would want a little more dressing than it called for so maybe a recipe and a half of that? It'd be good on any other salad so that would work for me!

This was the perfect recipe to use up a few things in the fridge. I used more pasta and less spinach left out the chicken and made only half the dressing.

I have made this a dozen times and everyone always loves it and asks for the recipe. I use farfalle instead of orzo and I leave out the chicken because I typically serve it as a side dish to some other protein. Tastes best when made the night before really let s the dressing sink in!

A great simple recipe.  I made it with boneless skinless chicken breasts and added a chopped onion for a bit more flavor, but I'm sure it would be just as good as directed.

Succulent and chicken breast are seldom found in the same sentence, but you can find them together here in this delightfully simple recipe, composed of a few common ingredients.   Chef John really shows off the flavor of chicken and mushrooms.  Yes, you may add more things, like wine, or aromatics, but the more additions, the more complications and subbing, and then the tweaking begins!  I chose not to view the video beforehand, just to check out the instructions and the cooking times.  I went on the low side of the recommended times, and the chicken came out perfectly, with rich, delicious mushrooms.  We really enjoyed our Sunday chicken today!	succulent and chicken breast are seldom found in the same sentence , but you can find them together here in this delightfully simple recipe , composed of a few common ingredients . chef john really sho ws off the flavor of chicken and mushrooms . yes , you may add more things , like wine , or aromatics , but the more additions , the more complications and subbing , and then the tweaking begins ! i chose n ot to view the video beforehand , just to check out the instructions and the cooking times . i went on the low side of the recommended times , and the chicken came out perfectly , with rich , delicious mu shrooms . we really enjoyed our sunday chicken today !	1
I followed this recipe to the T, and it came out delicious! It was simple, quick, and had only a few main ingredients so I didn't have to go to the store to get anything off hand. It also still tasted good when I reheated it for lunch. I think next time I may add in some onions, just for some more flavor, but it was delicious!	i followed this recipe to the t , and it came out delicious ! it was simple , quick , and had only a few main ingredients so i did n't have to go to the store to get anything off hand . it also still tasted good when i reheated it for lunch . i think next time i may add in some onions , just for some more flavor , but it was delicious !	1

Got this recipe from a top NY chef with one twist: rub skin side with your favorite pork/chicken rub ( grab one from the store-Stonewall great) then sprinkle on other side when chick is skin down. Fab favor and sauce. PS olive oil not needed as skin produces lots of rendered fat.-Drain excess when you turn chick in pan.	got this recipe from a top ny chef with one twist : rub skin side with your favorite pork/chicken rub -lrb- grab one from the store-stonewall great -rrb- then sprinkle on other side when chick is skin down . fab favor and sauce . ps olive oil not needed as skin produces lots of rendered fat.-drain excess when you turn chick in pan .	1

Excellent! I’m on a special low acid diet and this fit the bill. I did not use boneless chicken breasts because I believe that the marrow in the bones add flavor. I used a cast iron skillet instead of a stainless steel skillet and it reduced the time of caramelizing the mushrooms in half. I’m a seasoned cook and I always want to add something like wine or whatever to pan jus. I watched Chef John’s video of this recipe and I think that I saw him sneak in some cayenne pepper in the video. Chef John always has cayenne pepper in his recipes and I’d bet that he adds it to his oatmeal in the morning. :) I served this with Sarah’s Rice Pilaf recipe that is posted on this site and with green beans as the 2nd side dish. It was a delicious meal.	excellent ! i 'm on a special low acid diet and this fit the bill . i did not use boneless chicken breasts because i believe that the marrow in the bones add flavor . i used a cast iron skillet instead of a stainless steel skillet and it reduced the time of caramelizing the mushrooms in half . i 'm a seasoned cook and i always want to add something like wine or whatever to pan jus . i watched chef john 's video of this recipe and i think that i saw him sneak in some cayenne pepper in the video . chef john always has cayenne pepper in his recipes and i 'd bet that he adds it to his oatmeal in the morning . :-rrb- i served this with sarah 's rice pilaf recipe that is posted on this site and with green beans as the 2 nd side dish . it was a delicious meal .	1
The challenge factor made me curious, so I had to try it. The meat was good, tender and cooked through. The accompanying sauce, however, was unrelentingly bland..  To increase the flavor, simply using chicken stock in place of water would represent a huge leap forward in sensory quality. I mean, if adding butter was acceptable, why not stock? An interesting culinary exercise, however.	the challenge factor made me curious , so i had to try it . the meat was good , tender and cooked through . the accompanying sauce , however , was unrelentingly bland . . to increase the flavor , simply using chicken stock in place of water would represent a huge leap forward in sensory quality . i mean , if adding butter was acceptable , why not stock ? an interesting culinary exercise , however .	1
Delicious soup and very easy! This will be perfect this summer when everyone's garden is overflowing with zucchini! The only change I made (not by choice) was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken because I didn't realize I was out! Keep in mind this is why it may be a little bit darker in my picture. Still delicious though! I used an immersion blender and blended everything right in the pot instead of using my blender.

Never would have thought to turn squash into a soup. This was so simple and surprisingly delicious! My husband even added some shredded cheddar to his bowl of soup and liked it both ways.

Loved this!! So flavorful. I made it almost exactly to the recipe with a few minor changes. I had to add a couple of yellow squash to the zucchini to make the 8 cups. I also added minced garlic while boiling the veggies. The only other thing different was to add some dry dill and a couple of splashes of half and half I had on hand. That made it a little creamier. However I tried it before I did that and it was still amazing. This will definitely go into the rotation.	loved this !! so flavorful . i made it almost exactly to the recipe with a few minor changes . i had to add a couple of yellow squash to the zucchini to make the 8 cups . i also added minced garlic while boiling the veggies . the only other thing different was to add some dry dill and a couple of splashes of half and half i had on hand . that made it a little creamier . however i tried it before i did th at and it was still amazing . this will definitely go into the rotation .	1
A great way to use up those zucchini and summer squash! I thought this was a lot of veggies--it was a lot of soup! Will be freezing it for later. Only had enough squash for 6 cups instead of 8 still worked fine.	a great way to use up those zucchini and summer squash ! i thought this was a lot of veggies -- it was a lot of soup ! will be freezing it for later . only had enough squash for 6 cups instead of 8 still w orked fine .	1

These are very good but I would cut back on the honey. The lemon off sets the sweetness of the honey very well.

Very good. I sliced three regular size carrots into 1/8th inch rounds and used the recipe set to 1 serving. I also didn't have lemon juice so I used about an 1/8th of a teaspoon of lemon extract. The honey and lemon gave it a pleasant sweet taste and not at all overpowering.

I don't know who decided that carrots side dishes had to be covered in butter, honey, and sugar, but this recipe was a welcome relief.  I've made this with both fresh and dried dill.  Fresh is always better, but either way the pop from the vinegar and the hint of honey compliment the sweetness of the carrots just perfectly.	i do n't know who decided that carrots side dishes had to be covered in butter , honey , and sugar , but this recipe was a welcome relief . i 've made this with both fresh and dried dill . fresh is always better , but either way the pop from the vinegar and the hint of honey compliment the sweetness of the carrots just perfectly .	2

Perfection!!! One of the few recipes that make me wish there were more stars to pass out. Incredible not-too-sweet coffee cake! Only made a minor change: a bit more sugar and a splash of vanilla in the cream cheese layer. It is an extremely sticky dough so wet hands help a lot when spreading it out. I think it's best room temperature. I found that if this is stored in a tightly covered container it gets more moist as it sits making it even better the next day! Thanks so much! (I noticed one reviewer said the butter made it too salty-I was taught to always use unsalted butter when baking...this allows the cook to be in control of the saltiness of the end product.)	perfection !!! one of the few recipes that make me wish there were more stars to pass out . incredible not-too-sweet coffee cake ! only made a minor change : a bit more sugar and a splash of vanilla in th e cream cheese layer . it is an extremely sticky dough so wet hands help a lot when spreading it out . i think it 's best room temperature . i found that if this is stored in a tightly covered container i t gets more moist as it sits making it even better the next day ! thanks so much ! -lrb- i noticed one reviewer said the butter made it too salty-i was taught to always use unsalted butter when baking ... this allows the cook to be in control of the saltiness of the end product . -rrb-	1
This coffee cake is moist and delicious. It tastes amazing fresh out of the oven or chilled and even tastes good the next day.

Made this for Recipe Group...DELICIOUS! Made this exactly as written and it turned out wonderfully. The 'hardest' part was spreading the dough into the bottom of the pan but that was easily helped along w/ my hand and some cooking spray. Very simple to make and I liked the fact that it's not overly sweet just right! This makes a nice big cake so it's enough to feed a crowd. This would even be great w/ some fruit preserves added to the middle as well (not that it needs it b/c it doesn't). A definite keeper YUM!

This was a family favorite! Simple flavorful and extraordinarily fluffy. I'll probably use a little less yeast in future as the bread grew until it pressed the top of the machine but keeping everyone on tiptoes and out of the kitchen prevented any falling so the end product had a wonderful airy texture.

I could not find sun-dried tomato pesto at the store so I made my own with a combination of minced sun-dried tomatoes and pesto paste. Not as good as the real thing I am sure but still very tasty! Made a few changes: Used NY Strip steaks instead of rib-eye (delicious!) sauteed the spinach in garlic and olive oil before adding to pasta. Omitted olives added chopped onion and portabella mushroom to the steak instead of shallots. Used fresh grated parmesan cheese instead of feta. Definitely more of an italian taste than greek but was very delicious! Much lighter than I had expected. I will make this again and keep experimenting.	i could not find sun-dried tomato pesto at the store so i made my own with a combination of minced sun-dried tomatoes and pesto paste . not as good as the real thing i am sure but still very tasty ! mad e a few changes : used ny strip steaks instead of rib-eye -lrb- delicious ! -rrb- sauteed the spinach in garlic and olive oil before adding to pasta . omitted olives added chopped onion and portabella mushroom to the steak instead of shallots . used fresh grated parmesan cheese instead of feta . definitely more of an italian taste than greek but was very delicious ! much lighter than i had expected . i will make t his again and keep experimenting .	1
This was amazing--I was nervous about using sun-dried tomato pesto (we've never tried it) but it gave such a rich depth to the steak. When my husband came in he said it smelled like a restaurant. It was fun to make and unbelievably good with simple ingredients. I left out the olives and used asiago romano & parmesan cheese instead of the feta but I want to try it with feta. I had a bagged salad I needed to use so I served the pasta/steak mixture on a bed of greens and it was so good even down to the crunch of the sunflower seeds.

This is so good. I have made this twice already and love it! I leave out the black olives but that is personal preference. Also the only sun-dried tomato pesto I could find (after searching 3 supermarkets) is made by Classico. The jar is small about half the size of typical spaghetti sauces and will probably be on the top shelf. The pesto is amazing making the dish to die for!

I'm rating this based on flavor combination rather than cooking method because I prepared it differently than directed. I substituted leftover turkey so did not need to prepare chicken. Also I oven roasted my butternut squash and pecans. I added a chopped sweet onion to the mix when I roasted the squash. I really enjoyed the flavors together and will use this again after Thanksgiving.	i 'm rating this based on flavor combination rather than cooking method because i prepared it differently than directed . i substituted leftover turkey so did not need to prepare chicken . also i oven ro asted my butternut squash and pecans . i added a chopped sweet onion to the mix when i roasted the squash . i really enjoyed the flavors together and will use this again after thanksgiving .	1
I like versatile recipes and chose this recipe as a way to use up some leftover roast chicken and a different way to prepare Winter squash besides roasting or boiling. I also wanted a make ahead meal. I modified it by leaving the quinoa and goat cheese separate from the squash/nut/chicken mixture so that we could make up our own bowl to our taste. I found this warm recipe ticked all the boxes for sweet savory crunchy soft and comfort-food-like all -in -one-one-bowl goodness. Next time I'll add a green veggie on the side or a salad. Looking forward to trying it as a cold salad with balsamic as suggested.	i like versatile recipes and chose this recipe as a way to use up some leftover roast chicken and a different way to prepare winter squash besides roasting or boiling . i also wanted a make ahead meal . i modified it by leaving the quinoa and goat cheese separate from the squash/nut/chicken mixture so that we could make up our own bowl to our taste . i found this warm recipe ticked all the boxes for sweet savory crunchy soft and comfort-food-like all - in - one-one-bowl goodness . next time i 'll add a green veggie on the side or a salad . looking forward to trying it as a cold salad with balsamic as suggested .	1

I made this for dinner and it turned out really well. It was filling enough for a main course and we used the leftovers as a side salad the next day when we barbequed hamburgers. I added diced tomatoes and 1/2 cup of sun dried tomatoes to it as well and it was delicious.	i made this for dinner and it turned out really well . it was filling enough for a main course and we used the leftovers as a side salad the next day when we barbequed hamburgers . i added diced tomatoe s and 1/2 cup of sun dried tomatoes to it as well and it was delicious .	1

I love this recipe. I tried it out and it was so tasty. I could eat this over and over again. I don't always use olives and tomatoes seems like it might be overkill but when cooking the chicken I use sesame seed oil rice wine vinegar and some soy sauce as well as a bit of powdered ginger for a boost of flavor for the chicken all by itself. This is an excellent recipe.	i love this recipe . i tried it out and it was so tasty . i could eat this over and over again . i do n't always use olives and tomatoes seems like it might be overkill but when cooking the chicken i use sesame seed oil rice wine vinegar and some soy sauce as well as a bit of powdered ginger for a boost of flavor for the chicken all by itself . this is an excellent recipe .	1
This was absolutely delicious. I added cherry tomatoes and used 2 cups of bowtie pasta. I also seasoned the chicken with soy sauce and a little garlic before adding to the salad. Would make again.	this was absolutely delicious . i added cherry tomatoes and used 2 cups of bowtie pasta . i also seasoned the chicken with soy sauce and a little garlic before adding to the salad . would make again .	1
My Mom and Dad really liked this but I just thought it was OK. I kept thinking that it needed something like maybe some buffalo mozzeralla cut into cubes but both of my parents thought it was great as it was. We used 1 cup of chicken from a rotisserie chicken. I mixed the veggies with the dressing and put it in the fridge for an hour or so before we were ready to serve. I also cooked the pasta drained it and put it in the fridge an hour ahead of time. It helped to make the salad nicely chilled and helped to combine the flavors. I will probably make again for my hubby with the addition of the cheese.	my mom and dad really liked this but i just thought it was ok . i kept thinking that it needed something like maybe some buffalo mozzeralla cut into cubes but both of my parents thought it was great as it was . we used 1 cup of chicken from a rotisserie chicken . i mixed the veggies with the dressing and put it in the fridge for an hour or so before we were ready to serve . i also cooked the pasta dra ined it and put it in the fridge an hour ahead of time . it helped to make the salad nicely chilled and helped to combine the flavors . i will probably make again for my hubby with the addition of the c heese .	1

I didn't have olives or sunflower seeds. I used elbow macaroni and added steamed broccoli. I included carrots and tomatoes to add color to the salad. Glad to have a macaroni salad that doesn't have mayonnaise in it. Ingredients don't have to be measured.

This salad is delicious! I served it to my husband and brother and they both loved it. I did change a little bit of it though. I used Sun-Dried Tomato Chicken Sausage and a green pepper (that's what I had). It was great! I think this salad would be good with pineapple mandarin oranges and lots of other stuff.

I've made this several times, the first time following the directions exactly, but the bacon was undercooked and left the chicken very greasy.  The next time I pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave about half way first, but again, the chicken was a bit greasy and the bacon wasn't doing anything to compliment the chicken.  Now instead of bacon I wrap the chicken in prescutto and it's perfect!  The flavors mix very well with the feta and spinach stuffing.  It's now the first thing I cook for a guy when I want to impress him, and it works like a charm!  	i 've made this several times , the first time following the directions exactly , but the bacon was undercooked and left the chicken very greasy . the next time i pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave ab out half way first , but again , the chicken was a bit greasy and the bacon was n't doing anything to compliment the chicken . now instead of bacon i wrap the chicken in prescutto and it 's perfect ! the flavors mix very well with the feta and spinach stuffing . it 's now the first thing i cook for a guy when i want to impress him , and it works like a charm !	1
I too added a few of my own touches.  I skipped the bacon, brushing olive oil on top of the chicken instead.  Also, my family love mushrooms, so I chopped up mushroom, onion and threw in some bread crumbs into the stuffing, using egg as the binder instead of mayo....way yummy!	i too added a few of my own touches . i skipped the bacon , brushing olive oil on top of the chicken instead . also , my family love mushrooms , so i chopped up mushroom , onion and threw in some bread cr umbs into the stuffing , using egg as the binder instead of mayo ... way yummy !	1

This recipe as is I would not have enjoyed however I took the basis and added my own ingredients.  I first used monteray jack instead of feta because I don't like it.  Then to the spinach mix I added chopped onion and mushroom as well as chopped bacon instead of wrapping the chicken in bacon. Once the chicken was cooked I topped it with a bernaise sauce.  It was very rich and flavorful.

Wow - now this is a salad! It's full of vibrant colors and it's a great combination of flavors. I can see why the submitter gets rave reviews when it's served. I know I certainly did! And I'm glad I read through the reviews because I cut the sugar in half and that was plenty. I also opted for olive oil vs. veg. oil and dijon vs. dry mustard. You can definitely play with this to suite your tastes and you won't be disapppointed. I added some dried cranberries to the mix for that little extra something...

DELICIOUS!!! I am rating the dressing portion of this recipe only although I'm sure the salad with this dressing on it would still be five stars! I made half the recipe of dressing cutting the sugar back to 1/4 cup as other reviewers suggested and I used about 1 T. of finely minced sweet onion instead of the red onion. I had an apple that had been hanging around way too long and a few dried cranberries left in the bag so I added those to red leaf lettuce chopped green onion and toasted almonds for a marvelous salad that hubby and I both really liked. I'll be making this dressing again for sure!! Here's a little tip that I've used many times since I like to do as much ahead of time as possible. Chop apple and toss in a little of the dressing making sure to coat well then refrigerate until ready to toss the salad. This keeps the apples from turning brown - works like a charm!	delicious !!! i am rating the dressing portion of this recipe only although i 'm sure the salad with this dressing on it would still be five stars ! i made half the recipe of dressing cutting the sugar b ack to 1/4 cup as other reviewers suggested and i used about 1 t. of finely minced sweet onion instead of the red onion . i had an apple that had been hanging around way too long and a few dried cranbe rries left in the bag so i added those to red leaf lettuce chopped green onion and toasted almonds for a marvelous salad that hubby and i both really liked . i 'll be making this dressing again for sure !! here 's a little tip that i 've used many times since i like to do as much ahead of time as possible . chop apple and toss in a little of the dressing making sure to coat well then refrigerate until r eady to toss the salad . this keeps the apples from turning brown - works like a charm !	1
Excellent Salad! Very refreshing and a great addition to our Father's Day menu this year. Followed the recipe with the exception of using a couple of small shallots diced very small in place of the red onion. I don't care for a strong onion flavor so I didn't add them to the blender with the other ingredients. I stirred them into the finished dressing right before service. Worked great. We would be very happy to make this again.

Just got back from a family gathering. My salad bowl was the only empty one at the end of the meal. Everyone asked for the recipe even the men!

I was pretty disappointed considering everyone gave this recipe 5 stars. I thought the dressing was entirely too onion-y and the salad lacked flavor. Next time (if there is one) I would add less onion for sure hoping to combat the strong onion flavor.	i was pretty disappointed considering everyone gave this recipe 5 stars . i thought the dressing was entirely too onion-y and the salad lacked flavor . next time -lrb- if there is one -rrb- i would add less onion for sure hoping to combat the strong onion flavor .	1
Calling all avocado lovers! This particular recipe was extremely quick and easy. Very smooth and creamy! This is a great alternative to using mayo in my chicken salad all of the time. The sour cream adds just the right amount of acidity along with the lime. This recipe did call for blending the chicken with the avocado but I did see the review mentioning that it came out pasty. I have made it with the chicken blended and while I do not mind it I really enjoy chunks of chicken in my salad so I opted this time to add it after I have blended all of the other ingredients. I served it along with some brioche sliders and voila! Perfect for a group of friends too. Will continue to make this again and again!	calling all avocado lovers ! this particular recipe was extremely quick and easy . very smooth and creamy ! this is a great alternative to using mayo in my chicken salad all of the time . the sour cream a dds just the right amount of acidity along with the lime . this recipe did call for blending the chicken with the avocado but i did see the review mentioning that it came out pasty . i have made it with the chicken blended and while i do not mind it i really enjoy chunks of chicken in my salad so i opted this time to add it after i have blended all of the other ingredients . i served it along with so me brioche sliders and voila ! perfect for a group of friends too . will continue to make this again and again !	1

I made this and loved it! The only changes I made were using Greek yogurt instead of sour cream & I used half the amount of pepper (but next time might use even less). I also don't have a food processor so I kind of chopped the chicken then shredded by hand a little and it turned out just fine.

This recipe is delicious! A couple changes- instead of sour cream use 0% milk fat Greek yogurt. Tastes the same has less fat and is loaded with protein. Also I added some red onion for a little crunch! And because I love garlic I threw in a few cloves. We ate this on crackers and also rolled up in a tortilla.

This is good. I really liked the lime and avocado flavor with the chicken. I didn't add all the pepper--probably just a total of 1/4 t. I used canned chicken so I didn't puree any of it--just stirred it all around until creamy but with a few chunks. I took some out for myself and then I added diced red onion because my husband has to have raw onion in any chicken salad. I also added a few dashes of hot sauce to his.	this is good . i really liked the lime and avocado flavor with the chicken . i did n't add all the pepper -- probably just a total of 1/4 t. i used canned chicken so i did n't puree any of it -- just stirred it all around until creamy but with a few chunks . i took some out for myself and then i added diced red onion because my husband has to have raw onion in any chicken salad . i also added a few dashes o f hot sauce to his .	1
I loved this recipe (with some additions from the comments) - I reduced the oil, increased the juice, used rice wine vinegar, added the garlic and ginger and some sugar for the dressing - ABSOLUTELY necessary additions or else you're basically just pouring juice on your salad. - I also included red peppers in the salad and it was a HUGE hit.	i loved this recipe -lrb- with some additions from the comments -rrb- - i reduced the oil , increased the juice , used rice wine vinegar , added the garlic and ginger and some sugar for the dressing - absolutely n ecessary additions or else you 're basically just pouring juice on your salad . - i also included red peppers in the salad and it was a huge hit .	2
I made this recipe for my gourmet group in which I was doing a Luau theme. Everyone loved it. I made several changes though. I increased the pineapple juice to 1/2 cup and used extra (fresh only!!!) cutup pineapple on each individual plate. For presentation I also used some star fruit on each plate (looks pretty and adds more color). Also I decreased the onion to 2 and upped the coconut to 1/2 cup. I really wanted to bring out the tropical flavors of this recipe. I would definitely make this recipe again!	i made this recipe for my gourmet group in which i was doing a luau theme . everyone loved it . i made several changes though . i increased the pineapple juice to 1/2 cup and used extra -lrb- fresh only !!! -rrb- c utup pineapple on each individual plate . for presentation i also used some star fruit on each plate -lrb- looks pretty and adds more color -rrb- . also i decreased the onion to 2 and upped the coconut to 1/2 cup . i really wanted to bring out the tropical flavors of this recipe . i would definitely make this recipe again !	1
Great salad! Such a delicious combination. I used ready-made real bacon bits and they worked fine. Upped the amount of pineapple juice because I wanted more of that flavor. Also used canned pineapple tidbits. By using the canned pineapple and precooked bacon I saved a ton of time. Also used macadamia nuts (they were salted so I rinsed them off because toasting. My daughter liked it as well even though she doesn't like coconut. I have made tons of salads using various fruits but never have dabbled with pineapple in this kind of combination. This is my new favorite and I am going to say the best salad I have ever had in my life.	great salad ! such a delicious combination . i used ready-made real bacon bits and they worked fine . upped the amount of pineapple juice because i wanted more of that flavor . also used canned pineapple tidbits . by using the canned pineapple and precooked bacon i saved a ton of time . also used macadamia nuts -lrb- they were salted so i rinsed them off because toasting . my daughter liked it as well even th ough she does n't like coconut . i have made tons of salads using various fruits but never have dabbled with pineapple in this kind of combination . this is my new favorite and i am going to say the best salad i have ever had in my life .	1

This was a really tastey light and easy salad to make. I'm always looking for more salad recipes that encorporate fruit and greens. Everyone liked it.

Oh my goodness were we pleasantly surprised and rewarded on this! It looked just beautiful on the red leaf lettuce and the taste matched its presentation. The combination of creamy sour cream buttery smooth avocado and smoky bacon was just out of this world. Whether eaten on its own as a salad or served in tacos you will not be disappointed.

I'm originally from the Tampa Bay area and I grew up with avocado and key lime trees in my yard so I grew up with fresh guacamole in the wintertime or what passes for winter in Florida. When it comes to regular guacamole less ingredients are better but the avocados must be very ripe or it will lack flavor and creamy consistency. This salad is excellent but especially good if your avocados are a touch underripe for standard guacamole. I added a clove of garlic and substituted key lime juice for lemon. Key lime is tarter than regular lime and gives it a unique flavor. I would even suggest regular Persian lime instead of lemon in this recipe. Overall excellent as a dip or even condiment to tacos or fajitas.	i 'm originally from the tampa bay area and i grew up with avocado and key lime trees in my yard so i grew up with fresh guacamole in the wintertime or what passes for winter in florida . when it comes to regular guacamole less ingredients are better but the avocados must be very ripe or it will lack flavor and creamy consistency . this salad is excellent but especially good if your avocados are a to uch underripe for standard guacamole . i added a clove of garlic and substituted key lime juice for lemon . key lime is tarter than regular lime and gives it a unique flavor . i would even suggest regula r persian lime instead of lemon in this recipe . overall excellent as a dip or even condiment to tacos or fajitas .	1

This is VERY close to a recipe I used to make and have been searching for-- with the following changes:  1) instead of cooking fresh onion, dried chopped onion can be substituted (the liquids in the dish will reconstitue it,)  2) instead of cream of mush, use cream of celery soup, 3) lose all that salt and just use a little garlic powder, plus a dash or two of worcestershire instead of the lemon juice, and, 4) top with crushed cheez-its instead of Ritz-- the extra cheddar crunch gives the entire dish a great zing  (go crazy-- tabasco cheez-its are expecially good.)  No need to top with butter, the topping will brown nicely enough.  You can adjust the fat content by eliminating the butter and using low-fat soup.  I also use the canola Hellman's with no cholesterol.  Ditching the salt brings the sodium content down to next-to-nothing, even with the modicum of worcestershire. When all is said and done, what you're really making here is a custard-- that's why you mix the soup, eggs, and mayo together and then fold in the broccoli and the cheese.  It should never be runny.  The entire casserole can be assembled the day before and refrigerated, then the topping added right before cooking. Enjoy!	this is very close to a recipe i used to make and have been searching for -- with the following changes : 1 -rrb- instead of cooking fresh onion , dried chopped onion can be substituted -lrb- the liquids in the d ish will reconstitue it , -rrb- 2 -rrb- instead of cream of mush , use cream of celery soup , 3 -rrb- lose all that salt and just use a little garlic powder , plus a dash or two of worcestershire instead of the lemon j uice , and , 4 -rrb- top with crushed cheez-its instead of ritz -- the extra cheddar crunch gives the entire dish a great zing -lrb- go crazy -- tabasco cheez-its are expecially good . -rrb- no need to top with butter , the topping will brown nicely enough . you can adjust the fat content by eliminating the butter and using low-fat soup . i also use the canola hellman 's with no cholesterol . ditching the salt brings the sodium content down to next-to-nothing , even with the modicum of worcestershire . when all is said and done , what you 're really making here is a custard -- that 's why you mix the soup , eggs , and ma yo together and then fold in the broccoli and the cheese . it should never be runny . the entire casserole can be assembled the day before and refrigerated , then the topping added right before cooking . enjoy !	2
This is my all time favorite comfort food! The only changes I made, were to use Egg Beaters, reduced fat cheddar cheese, reduced fat or fat free mayo, reduced fat Ritz and fat free cream of mushroom soup.  Since this is such a flavorful recipe, you really cannot tell the difference at all.  We did a side by side taste comparison – no difference.  Too much time on our hands I guess, but we saved a bunch of fat and calories!	this is my all time favorite comfort food ! the only changes i made , were to use egg beaters , reduced fat cheddar cheese , reduced fat or fat free mayo , reduced fat ritz and fat free cream of mushroom s oup . since this is such a flavorful recipe , you really can not tell the difference at all . we did a side by side taste comparison -- no difference . too much time on our hands i guess , but we saved a bunch of fat and calories !	1

I didn't like this too much. When I think of broccoli casserole, I assume it will have a cheese flavor to it. This had way too much mayonaise for me and i love mayonaise. Everyone said it was pretty good, but I won't make it again. It did look nice.	i did n't like this too much . when i think of broccoli casserole , i assume it will have a cheese flavor to it . this had way too much mayonaise for me and i love mayonaise . everyone said it was pretty g ood , but i wo n't make it again . it did look nice .	1
Thanks for trying my recipe and I'm glad you all liked it so much! The only difference between this and Succotash is the addition of green lima beans. Also I noticed that some of the changes they made to my wording when the edited my recipe made it more difficult to understand. The Thyme is optional and the Thyme and Parsley should be finely chopped not minced. Also to cook and stir is to saute. I've used sweet corn or shoepeg corn for this recipe and it's wonderful either way. You can also substitute chicken broth for the beef broth and add a little sage or substitute seafood broth and add schrimp for some different flavors.

This is one delicious side dish. I used yellow and white corn more creole seasoning spicy salt in place of the salt and cayene. Oh and about four rashers of thick cut pepper bacon (more YUM!). I also used about a cup or so of beef broth and let it simmer down and absorb all of that flavor. Highly recommended thanks so much for sharing this. It's a do-over for sure.	this is one delicious side dish . i used yellow and white corn more creole seasoning spicy salt in place of the salt and cayene . oh and about four rashers of thick cut pepper bacon -lrb- more yum ! -rrb- . i also used about a cup or so of beef broth and let it simmer down and absorb all of that flavor . highly recommended thanks so much for sharing this . it 's a do-over for sure .	1

I really liked this! I used a yellow pepper vs. celery because I thought it would blend in with my Mardi Gras theme better!! I didn't use the bacon only because I have vegetarian friends. I know it will be that much better with the bacon though! I also used cajun seasoning vs. creole because I wanted more spice.

I made this recipe for the weekly recipe group selection. I've never had this dish before so can't really compare it to others. We enjoyed it my son really loved it. I didn't simmer the veggies as long we like a bit of crisp to them. Served up with some grilled Cajun Chicken from this site a great pair.	i made this recipe for the weekly recipe group selection . i 've never had this dish before so ca n't really compare it to others . we enjoyed it my son really loved it . i did n't simmer the veggies as lon g we like a bit of crisp to them . served up with some grilled cajun chicken from this site a great pair .	1
I do NOT recommend that you make this for a party or gathering of some kind. When you are done preparing it you have to taste it to ensure it is worthy of putting your name on (like any good chef would). One taste bite leads to a second third next thing you know you have polished off more than half of it. I stuck to the recipe and it is fantastic. My wife HATES peas. I mean won't eat them if they are the only thing left between her and starvation. So I gave her a blind taste test and even she LOVED it.	i do not recommend that you make this for a party or gathering of some kind . when you are done preparing it you have to taste it to ensure it is worthy of putting your name on -lrb- like any good chef woul d -rrb- . one taste bite leads to a second third next thing you know you have polished off more than half of it . i stuck to the recipe and it is fantastic . my wife hates peas . i mean wo n't eat them if they are the only thing left between her and starvation . so i gave her a blind taste test and even she loved it .	1

This was very good and was well received at our Easter dinner. It is one of those salads that gets better the longer it sits. Leftovers the next day were just as good or even better than on day 1!

I made the recipe as written except I used regular raisins as that's what I had on hand and omitted the bacon but sprinkled bacon bits on top. I think it would be better if the sunflower seeds and cheese were at least doubled. Slivered or sliced almonds could be used instead of the sunflower seeds--would add a little more crunch plus visual interest. Chow mein noodles could also be sprinkled across the top for extra crunch.	i made the recipe as written except i used regular raisins as that 's what i had on hand and omitted the bacon but sprinkled bacon bits on top . i think it would be better if the sunflower seeds and che ese were at least doubled . slivered or sliced almonds could be used instead of the sunflower seeds -- would add a little more crunch plus visual interest . chow mein noodles could also be sprinkled acros s the top for extra crunch .	1
I thought this was fantastic!  I live in New Orleans and believe the taste to be authentic.  Due to previous reviews about it being too runny, I drained the tomatoes (I used diced tomatoes with onion, celery, and green peppers).  I omitted the pepper (my family doesn't like them), and added 4 or so cloves of sliced garlic (a must!).  I used Tony Chachere's seasoning, and only 1/2 tsp. cayenne and I thought it was perfect, but some (like my mother-in-law who is very sensitive), might find it a big spicy (nothing a little sour cream on top won't fix :D).  Finally, I planned on adding rice directly in the crock pot, but it turned out to actually be too dry (may be because it cooked for 9 1/2 hours), so I had to cook the rice separately, then stirred it in with about 1/2 cup of extra chicken broth.

"I have never been a real jambalaya fan...but this is the BOMB!  I love the combination of chicken, sausage and shrimp.  The only things I do different... I don't like cooked celery, so I omit that...and I serve it over red beans a rice that I make from a package, instead of plain white rice.  Oh I also use uncooked shrimp and add it a little earlier to the crock pot...cooked shrimp tends to get too chewy.

YUM YUM YUM - always requested...and this year we're having a Cajun themed Christmas of which this dish will be the main meal."	i have never been a real jambalaya fan ... but this is the bomb ! i love the combination of chicken , sausage and shrimp . the only things i do different ... i do n't like cooked celery , so i omit that ... a nd i serve it over red beans a rice that i make from a package , instead of plain white rice . oh i also use uncooked shrimp and add it a little earlier to the crock pot ... cooked shrimp tends to get to o chewy . yum yum yum - always requested ... and this year we 're having a cajun themed christmas of which this dish will be the main meal .	1
My whole family loved this recipe. I would not cut down on the spices like some suggested. I don't like things too spicy and this had kick but was not too hot. I also would make the rice separate and pour the jambalaya over it. I tried adding the rice to the crock pot and it absorbed all of the liquid too quickly not allowing the rice to fully cook.	my whole family loved this recipe . i would not cut down on the spices like some suggested . i do n't like things too spicy and this had kick but was not too hot . i also would make the rice separate and pour the jambalaya over it . i tried adding the rice to the crock pot and it absorbed all of the liquid too quickly not allowing the rice to fully cook .	1
When I made this chili I used 3 cans of beans 2cups of frozen corn & 2cups of chicken broth instead of the water. The other thing different I did was let it cook in a crock pot on high for about 6 hrs. There was not even a drop left that football Sunday!

I only used one green and one red pepper black beans instead of kidney and crushed tomatoes instead of diced due to FC (finicky child) and she still didn't like this soup.

I used a combination of red, orange and yellow organic peppers and I threw in a bunch of fresh minced garlic and three coarsely chopped zucchini in with the chopped veggies/chicken. Instead of kidney beans, I used organic black beans because that's what I had on hand. I used organic chicken broth instead of water to add a little more flavor and after tasting it, I added in onion powder, ground coriander, oregano, paprika, and a little Splenda brown sugar blend and threw in a bit more cumin and chili powder. This soup is very tasty.

I was not at all impressed with this chili. To me it tasted like it was definitely missing something and I could not figure out what it was. This soup was watery and the chicken didn't soak up the flavor well at all. It was extremely bland. I eventually added some hot sauce oregano and cheese which seemed to help some.

The genius of this recipe is the first step - roasting ribs in the oven. This removes fat and liquid that would otherwise cause soupy results in the crockpot. For this, it deserves 5 stars!! Use any sauce (I like 1 C. ketchup, 1 C. Stubb's barbecue sauce, 2 T. brown sugar, 1 t. Worcestershire, and Tabasco hot sauce to taste.) The original sauce recipe (which I've tried) isn't sharp or hot enough for our tastes. We use boneless beef chuck country ribs, 2 lbs. or more. Stir once during cooking time so ribs don't stick to sides and burn. To thicken sauce a bit, put the crockpot on High, with the lid ajar, during the last half hour.

OH MY GOSH--these were the most incredible ribs I have ever tasted in or out of a restaraunt! I followed other reviewers' advice and substituted bbq sauce for the ketchup (2 cups) and ketchup for the chili sauce. (1 cup) I cut back on the vinegar to 2 1/2 Tbsp. just because I thought 4 Tbsp. was a lot. I also left out the hot sauce simply because I didn't have any on hand. I used boneless Country Style Ribs. I couldn't get them out of the crock pot in one piece they were soo tender! Thank you so much for this recipe it is definitely one of the BEST on this site!!!

This rib recipe convinced my dinner guest that he needs a slow cooker! I substituted the 2 cup equivalent of my favorite BBQ sauce for the ketchup and they were delicious. I would also recommend rotating the ribs halfway through the cooking process if possible so that all the ribs are equally tender.

This recipe is great!!! The meat was sooo tender and the sauce was tasty with a good kick but not overwhelmingly spicy. I wouldn't change a thing except up the chili sauce and hot sauce if you're a fan of more heat. And just a note to several of the other reviewers... If you just dumped a bottle of barbeque sauce into the slow cooker instead of following the recipe to at least some degree you really have no reason to write a review. Trust me this sauce tastes nothing like KC Masterpiece all you really did was look at this to find out how long to cook them.

What an excellent breakfast this made! I toasted a slice of baguette in the pan that I cooked the Prosciutto in which was a great addition.

Just finished this dish and loved it. Minor changes - used bacon since that's all I had on hand and didn't use any oil just a little bacon fat w/the bacon pieces and salt and pepper on the asparagus. As someone else mentioned - great low carb dish and healthy (if you don't use too much bacon;). Next time I might try some grated Parmesan on top.	just finished this dish and loved it . minor changes - used bacon since that 's all i had on hand and did n't use any oil just a little bacon fat w/the bacon pieces and salt and pepper on the asparagus . as someone else mentioned - great low carb dish and healthy -lrb- if you do n't use too much bacon ;-rrb- . next time i might try some grated parmesan on top .	1

I will make this easy recipe again but with some changes. I loved the spice mixture but it wasn't enough to adequately cover/rub four breasts so I had make another batch. Also, way, way, WAY too much garlic powder at the end. It overpowered the other flavors, especially the lime.  I will reduce the amount of garlic powder and double the other ingredients in the future.	i will make this easy recipe again but with some changes . i loved the spice mixture but it was n't enough to adequately cover/rub four breasts so i had make another batch . also , way , way , way too much garlic powder at the end . it overpowered the other flavors , especially the lime . i will reduce the amount of garlic powder and double the other ingredients in the future .	1
This was good but needed some help. First of all do cut chicken breasts into pieces & pound thin. Second don't double the lime juice unless you want it sour. Use 3 TBLSP first (juice of one small lime) and then taste-test the sauce then adjust as needed. The sauce also could benefit from a little chicken broth added when you put in the lime juice.	this was good but needed some help . first of all do cut chicken breasts into pieces & pound thin . second do n't double the lime juice unless you want it sour . use 3 tblsp first -lrb- juice of one small lime -rrb- and then taste-test the sauce then adjust as needed . the sauce also could benefit from a little chicken broth added when you put in the lime juice .	1
This recipe just replaced my old Lime Chicken recipe.  It was wonderful!  So simple and easy, too.  I fixed the marinade in the morning, bumped up the heat-factor a little, used fresh cilantro from my garden (made all the difference) and threw it in a bag along with the juice of a couple limes.  I marinated it all afternoon and then threw it on the grill.  While grilling, I coated it with coarse ground pepper and squeezed fresh lime juice on each side.  Definitly a keeper!  My husband was disappointed he was travelling the next day and couldn't take the leftovers for lunch.  Instead, I sliced up the cold chicken and served it on a salad.  MMMMMMmmmmmm-good!

I'm scratching my head over the glowing reviews. To my palate garlic powder tastes nothing at all like garlic! To me, the flavor is plain nasty. I can't understand why anyone would use a  fake-tasting product when the real thing is both inexpensive and readily available. If you want to make this dish worlds better, mash 3-4 garlic cloves to a paste. Apply to the chicken with the spices. For the sauce, mash another clove or two of garlic (or to taste) and replace that awful powder. Infinitely superior, fresh, and tasty. Try it this way - you won't believe the difference!	i 'm scratching my head over the glowing reviews . to my palate garlic powder tastes nothing at all like garlic ! to me , the flavor is plain nasty . i ca n't understand why anyone would use a fake-tasting product when the real thing is both inexpensive and readily available . if you want to make this dish worlds better , mash 3 - 4 garlic cloves to a paste . apply to the chicken with the spices . for the sa uce , mash another clove or two of garlic -lrb- or to taste -rrb- and replace that awful powder . infinitely superior , fresh , and tasty . try it this way - you wo n't believe the difference !	1
We liked this recipe. I did cut back on the butter (used half the recommended) but followed everything else in recipe. I think next time I will saute the garlic in the butter a bit before adding the remaining ingredients for the sauce. Also I will allow the sauce contents to boil for a couple of minutes to allow the sauce to thicken a bit so that it will stick to the broccoli a bit better. Overall good recipe...I'll be making this again.	we liked this recipe . i did cut back on the butter -lrb- used half the recommended -rrb- but followed everything else in recipe . i think next time i will saute the garlic in the butter a bit before adding the r emaining ingredients for the sauce . also i will allow the sauce contents to boil for a couple of minutes to allow the sauce to thicken a bit so that it will stick to the broccoli a bit better . overall good recipe ... i 'll be making this again .	1
Just made this for the first time and I will absolutely make it again! I only used about 3 tablespoons of butter insead of the full 5 and didn't seem to miss anything.

This broccoli is sooo good. I made it twice already for a family get together and a party at work and everyone loved it. I had so many people ask for the recipe.

This was the highlight of the dinner I made tonight. I was surprised when we all ignored our chicken in order to eat more broccoli. I used half broccoli and half sliced onions which was very good over rice. I think I'll add some more vegetables next time-- bell pepper celery maybe carrots or water chestnuts-- and serve it over rice as a vegetarian stir-fry. Thanks so much for the recipe. It's excellent! I used half the amount of butter called for to cut down on the fat.	this was the highlight of the dinner i made tonight . i was surprised when we all ignored our chicken in order to eat more broccoli . i used half broccoli and half sliced onions which was very good over rice . i think i 'll add some more vegetables next time -- bell pepper celery maybe carrots or water chestnuts -- and serve it over rice as a vegetarian stir-fry . thanks so much for the recipe . it 's exce llent ! i used half the amount of butter called for to cut down on the fat .	1

Very tasty. I followed this recipe to the letter. It’s way too soft and soggy due to, I would guess, the chicken stock. The last time I made it I found a similar recipe that lacks the balsamic vinegar, and chicken stock. Everything else was  basically the same. That recipe was much better and the leftovers were still tasty.	very tasty . i followed this recipe to the letter . it 's way too soft and soggy due to , i would guess , the chicken stock . the last time i made it i found a similar recipe that lacks the balsamic vinegar , and chicken stock . everything else was basically the same . that recipe was much better and the leftovers were still tasty .	1
Really good.  Added some fresh parmesan at the end and it worked well.  Love this because it is so easy, no special ingredients and is an amazing way to get kids to eat vegetables...our girls loved it.  I used pancetta instead of bacon...I find it better for cooking in situations like this.	really good . added some fresh parmesan at the end and it worked well . love this because it is so easy , no special ingredients and is an amazing way to get kids to eat vegetables ... our girls loved it . i used pancetta instead of bacon ... i find it better for cooking in situations like this .	1

Made it as written and it was very good.  But I felt that it could do with less bacon/drippings and would still be good.  The method of preparations was simple.  I think that next time, and there will be a next time,  that I would  reduce the amount of the bacon/drippings and the butter.  With all the fat that's in this recipe, it turns a very healthy side dish into one that's high in calories and fats.	made it as written and it was very good . but i felt that it could do with less bacon/drippings and would still be good . the method of preparations was simple . i think that next time , and there will be a next time , that i would reduce the amount of the bacon/drippings and the butter . with all the fat that 's in this recipe , it turns a very healthy side dish into one that 's high in calories and fats .	1

Oh My Goodness...made these this evening. Shaved them with my ceramic slicer and nothing could be easier. Used olive oil and butter then tossed in some REAL bacon bits at the end...Let them sit in the pan long enough to get a bit of brown/caramalized and they were delicious and nutty...even the teenaged boys who turned up their noses dove back for seconds. FOUR teens ate brussels sprouts!!! Hades has frozen over in our city.

I have been making a similar recipe for years and it has been a hit with even the non-brussel sprout lovers. I make it with a few differences.....instead of almonds I use pine nuts. this is a very nice taste saute until lightly toasted and use seasoning salt. Also at he end with the crumbled bacon add sliced green onion tops.

I agree that this recipe is a great crowd pleaser but 4 pounds of Brussels sprouts is WAY too much. I used half that amount with the same amount of the other ingredients and it worked perfectly. I served it for 8 people and we had plenty of leftovers which reheated surprisingly well.	i agree that this recipe is a great crowd pleaser but 4 pounds of brussels sprouts is way too much . i used half that amount with the same amount of the other ingredients and it worked perfectly . i ser ved it for 8 people and we had plenty of leftovers which reheated surprisingly well .	1

This was great. We used about 2 lbs or less of sprouts. My husband cut the sprouts up in 1/3's or 1/4's and it still turned out great. We realized we didn't have almonds and used pistachios and still good. I'd recommend this to brussel sprout fans.	this was great . we used about 2 lbs or less of sprouts . my husband cut the sprouts up in 1/3 's or 1/4 's and it still turned out great . we realized we did n't have almonds and used pistachios and still good . i 'd recommend this to brussel sprout fans .	1

Very good!! My husband and I loved it. I did half the recipe and it was still a HUGE amount... could have fed a family of 6 easily. Make sure you use thick slices of bacon so that you get enough fat to cook with also make sure you slice them thin. I got a little lazy near the end of my slicing and the thick pieces took longer to cook.

Sounded great but was NOT exciting. It made way too much (and we eat large portions of veg) needed to cook A LOT longer than stated and I had to add oil while cooking to help wilt it. It's possible that since I used center cut bacon that was the problem but I will not be making this recipe as written again. I too had to doctor this up to eat it and was left with a big ol' container of leftovers that nobody ate.	sounded great but was not exciting . it made way too much -lrb- and we eat large portions of veg -rrb- needed to cook a lot longer than stated and i had to add oil while cooking to help wilt it . it 's possible th at since i used center cut bacon that was the problem but i will not be making this recipe as written again . i too had to doctor this up to eat it and was left with a big ol' container of leftovers th at nobody ate .	1

Wow. This recipe is a keeper. I followed the recipe to a T and I wasn't disappointed. These meatballs were intended for sub sandwiches with marinara, but after tasting them fresh out of the oven, I felt like I was doing an injustice to this fine specimen of meat by slopping marinara over it.

Awesome recipe! I didn't have creme fraiche so I used sour cream plus I subsituted buttermilk for the milk. To add alittle thickness to the soup base one can of cream of chicken soup really did the trick. The biscuits were so light and fluffy but still had great texture and flavor. 'My family loves alittle heat...so I added a jalapeno cut lengthwise during the cooking process and fished it out before adding the dumplings!

My wife loves to make chicken and dumplings so I thought I'd surprise her with this more advanced recipe. I was a little disappointed. IT was very watery with very little flavor.

Excellent!  I followed the recipe for the most part.  I used 2 stalks chopped celery, 2 cans College Inn Chicken Broth, 1 Cup Milk, 1 Cup Heavy Cream.  I also did not puree the broccoli.  I like a chunky soup.  For the roux I melted the butter and removed from heat.  Then I measured the 3 Tbs. flour in a small bowl and added a little bit at a time of the milk/cream mixture and whisked it till smooth.  Then I added it to the melted butter.  Then added that to the soup.  NO LUMPS!  Served with Grated Cheddar Cheese and Warm French Bread.  So good on a Hurricane Wilma night.	excellent ! i followed the recipe for the most part . i used 2 stalks chopped celery , 2 cans college inn chicken broth , 1 cup milk , 1 cup heavy cream . i also did not puree the broccoli . i like a chu nky soup . for the roux i melted the butter and removed from heat . then i measured the 3 tbs . flour in a small bowl and added a little bit at a time of the milk/cream mixture and whisked it till smoo th . then i added it to the melted butter . then added that to the soup . no lumps ! served with grated cheddar cheese and warm french bread . so good on a hurricane wilma night .	1
This soup is wonderful. I made only minor adjustments to suit my tastes. I left out the celery and added fresh garlic more onion and red pepper flakes. I also added a bit of cream cheese when I was blending the soup. I used half milk and half evaporated milk and added a pinch of nutmeg at the end. This is definitely going into the recipe box.

I avoid making reviewing recipes that i have made changes to because i feel that it isn't really the recipe if i do that however that being said the only change i have ever made to this recipe is i a use a bag of frozen chopped brocoli i put the stems in before i puree and the floret bits in after I like my soup a little chunky.	i avoid making reviewing recipes that i have made changes to because i feel that it is n't really the recipe if i do that however that being said the only change i have ever made to this recipe is i a use a bag of frozen chopped brocoli i put the stems in before i puree and the floret bits in after i like my soup a little chunky .	1
I would give it 5 but I made adjustments. I added a clove of garlic to the onion/celery mix. I also added 1 shredded carrot to the broccoli. I used veg. base instead of chicken to make it vegetarian. Also I added sharp cheddar to the milk rue. Much better than using Velveeta.

Torn about reviews and what I really thought of this recipe. I really didn't care for this recipe at all. Followed it to a T and it was more of an overly gritty texture of broccoli then a creamy soup. And bland. No umph of flavor. As much salt and pepper as I had to use it still was not very flavorful as other cream of broccoli soups that I've had. So sorry it needs something.	torn about reviews and what i really thought of this recipe . i really did n't care for this recipe at all . followed it to a t and it was more of an overly gritty texture of broccoli then a creamy soup . and bland . no umph of flavor . as much salt and pepper as i had to use it still was not very flavorful as other cream of broccoli soups that i 've had . so sorry it needs something .	1
I made this soup and my husband (who is not a really big soup fan) could not get enough of it.  Only difference I made to the recipe was using 1 cup milk and 1 cup cream (since I had it on hand), rather than 2 cups 2%.  Also, I didn't have the full amount of cheddar, so I threw in maybe 1/3 cup slab of veleeta to make up the difference.  But I almost never have velveeta, and would recommend sticking with the cheddar just out of principle's sake.  I used the stock to make the flour thickener rather than the milk/cream (just a preference).  Then I added the milk and cream at the end with the cheese.  It was definitely a delicious and thick soup, just like Panera's.  Yum! Thanks a bunch, gildawen!	i made this soup and my husband -lrb- who is not a really big soup fan -rrb- could not get enough of it . only difference i made to the recipe was using 1 cup milk and 1 cup cream -lrb- since i had it on hand -rrb- , rath er than 2 cups 2 % . also , i did n't have the full amount of cheddar , so i threw in maybe 1/3 cup slab of veleeta to make up the difference . but i almost never have velveeta , and would recommend sticki ng with the cheddar just out of principle 's sake . i used the stock to make the flour thickener rather than the milk/cream -lrb- just a preference -rrb- . then i added the milk and cream at the end with the che ese . it was definitely a delicious and thick soup , just like panera 's . yum ! thanks a bunch , gildawen !	2
This has the potential to be a really great broccoli cheese soup.  As is, it’s just o.k.   To me it tasted like broccoli with cheese sauce.  It was bland and seemed to be lacking something.   I’m thinking it’s the cooking process.  It seems backwards.  Typically, milk products are added last because simmering can cause curdling, especially if simmered for a long period of time.  It works out o.k. for this recipe because it’s so thick from the cheese that you don’t really notice.   What I found odd was that half of the cooking time is dedicated to just simmering the milk with plain stock, absent of any vegetables or seasonings of any kind.  It’s only in the latter stage when you add the vegetables and those are only cooked just long enough until tender.   Onions, celery, and carrots are essential when it comes to adding flavor to any soup broth and it takes time to develop that flavor.  I would suggest adding those 3 ingredients to the chicken broth at the beginning so they have more cook time.  The other change I would make is when to add the milk.  I would start by adding the broth to the flour first and then the milk, but that’s just me.	this has the potential to be a really great broccoli cheese soup . as is , it 's just o.k. to me it tasted like broccoli with cheese sauce . it was bland and seemed to be lacking something . i 'm thin king it 's the cooking process . it seems backwards . typically , milk products are added last because simmering can cause curdling , especially if simmered for a long period of time . it works out o.k. for this recipe because it 's so thick from the cheese that you do n't really notice . what i found odd was that half of the cooking time is dedicated to just simmering the milk with plain stock , absen t of any vegetables or seasonings of any kind . it 's only in the latter stage when you add the vegetables and those are only cooked just long enough until tender . onions , celery , and carrots are ess ential when it comes to adding flavor to any soup broth and it takes time to develop that flavor . i would suggest adding those 3 ingredients to the chicken broth at the beginning so they have more co ok time . the other change i would make is when to add the milk . i would start by adding the broth to the flour first and then the milk , but that 's just me .	1
I hate to leave a 2-star unfavorable review. However to be fair to those who want to try this in the future I want to give my opinion: it was bland and utterly tasteless. I was so disappointed that I didn't care how close it was to Panera's recipe -- I just wanted flavor! I ended up adding a tablespoon of garlic powder and 2 tablespoons of powdered chicken broth base (2 chicken bouillon cubes would work too) and this did the trick! We ended up with a very tasty soup for dinner and I will make this regularly throughout the winter WITH my additions. Good luck!	i hate to leave a 2 star unfavorable review . however to be fair to those who want to try this in the future i want to give my opinion : it was bland and utterly tasteless . i was so disappointed that i did n't care how close it was to panera 's recipe -- i just wanted flavor ! i ended up adding a tablespoon of garlic powder and 2 tablespoons of powdered chicken broth base -lrb- 2 chicken bouillon cubes woul d work too -rrb- and this did the trick ! we ended up with a very tasty soup for dinner and i will make this regularly throughout the winter with my additions . good luck !	1

I'm rating it 3 because I have to rate it. But for a suggestion since I've made the Panera copycat before. First is to blend the ingredients, minus the cheese, in a blender. Second, the secret ingredient is a pinch of nutmeg to the final product. And btw making a roux before adding the liquids gives it more depth.	i 'm rating it 3 because i have to rate it . but for a suggestion since i 've made the panera copycat before . first is to blend the ingredients , minus the cheese , in a blender . second , the secret ingredi ent is a pinch of nutmeg to the final product . and btw making a roux before adding the liquids gives it more depth .	1
I had been craving broccoli cheddar soup and went with this one since it looked easy and had great reviews. I left out the carrots and salt by choice and added 3 chicken bouillon cubes.

Don't bother with the butter; you don't need it at all. And do NOT--as some other reviewers have suggested--mix up the flour/sugar mixture with the fruit before adding the fruit to the pie shell. The reason you want copious amounts of sugar both on the bottom and on the top of the fruit (rather than mixed amongst it) is that while baking, the bubbling-hot sugar carmelizes in contact with the bottom and top crusts, a process which makes the crusts rather crispy in the final product. If you mix the sugar up with the fruit, you don't get that crispy crust, and the large amount of water in the rhubarb will definitely make the bottom crust sodden. Don't worry: the sugar makes its way through the fruit anyway, so you won't have parts of the pie too sweet and other parts too tart.	do n't bother with the butter ; you do n't need it at all . and do not -- as some other reviewers have suggested -- mix up the flour/sugar mixture with the fruit before adding the fruit to the pie shell . the reason you want copious amounts of sugar both on the bottom and on the top of the fruit -lrb- rather than mixed amongst it -rrb- is that while baking , the bubbling-hot sugar carmelizes in contact with the botto m and top crusts , a process which makes the crusts rather crispy in the final product . if you mix the sugar up with the fruit , you do n't get that crispy crust , and the large amount of water in the rhu barb will definitely make the bottom crust sodden . do n't worry : the sugar makes its way through the fruit anyway , so you wo n't have parts of the pie too sweet and other parts too tart .	2
AMAZING PIE!!!! So simple...so easy! I thought for sure that it would turn out too sweet because it seemed like a lot of sugar. But it was perfect! You still get that tart zip of the rhubarb that I love! I also added some cinnamon to the sugar mixture..just because I love that flavor. Make sure to put some of the sugar mixture on the bottom like the recipe states. This forms a layer under the rhubarb while baking so that the crust doesn't get soggy. My dad said that this pie tastes almost identical to the one his Mom used to make. That alone will make me use this recipe over and over again!

This was fabulous.  I did make some little changes tho--I upped the rhubarb per pie to 6cups (could have done fine with 8 I think), kept sugar at 1 1/3 cup, upped the flour by half for a non-running pie...added 1 tsp cinnamon to the flour/sugar mix, and a few drops of vanilla to the pie all around, before baking..milk and sugar on top before baking made a flaky, crispy top crust--gosh but the kids LOVED THIS, so did the husband...out of vanilla ice cream so used some RediWhip instead.  Did 2 of these today, but next time I'll do 3 or 4 on one day.

Great basic recipe that does the trick for rhubarb lovers! Perfect combination of tart & sweet.  My only suggestion is to brush the top of the pie with one egg mixed with a tbsp water and sprinkle with sugar.  Repeat about halfway through.  Helps keep the crust from browing too fast and gives it a really sweet crispy finish.

this was a very good homemade cake recipe.... the only reason i'm giving it 4 stars is b/c the topping didn't turn out the way i thought..it was very oooey gooey and i thought it was supposed to be kinda crispy ....

WHEN YOUR CAKE IS DONE BAKING AND HAS COOLED........IF YOUR TOPPING IS KINDA RUNNY/GOOEY/NOT CRISPY ENUF FOR YOUR LIKING( you can only tell by flipping it out of the pan first) COVER A PAN IN FOIL AND PLACE CAKE ON PAN (topping up) and place cake in oven on BROIL for a few minutes (depending on how crispy you want it) the pineapple will get a little brown also, but it really helped the topping and still tasted delicious!	this was a very good homemade cake recipe ... . the only reason i 'm giving it 4 stars is b/c the topping did n't turn out the way i thought . . it was very oooey gooey and i thought it was supposed to be ki nda crispy ... -lrb- i baked it exactly as the recipe said , i did n't lower the temp . -rrb- so read this if you are making this recipe ... . when your cake is done baking and has cooled ... if your topping is kinda runny/gooey/not crispy enuf for your liking -lrb- you can only tell by flipping it out of the pan first -rrb- cover a pan in foil and place cake on pan -lrb- topping up -rrb- and place cake in oven on broil for a f ew minutes -lrb- depending on how crispy you want it -rrb- the pineapple will get a little brown also , but it really helped the topping and still tasted delicious !	2
This cake is absolutely perfect! My only complaint is my family started cutting away at my beautiful creation before I could take a picture to post. I followed the recipe as is. I did add a little, too. After I put the brown sugar mix in I sprinkled coconut on top and then layered the pineapple and added some maraschino cherries to the design. I made two cakes and after they cooled I stacked them. SIMPLY WONDERFUL -  especially the cake's texture and the way the candied sauce just melts into the cake without making it soggy. Someone said they didn't know what stiff but not dry egg whites meant. When you hit that foamy looking stage turn your mixer up and keep going for another minute or so. The egg whites will leave ripples and look shiny.	this cake is absolutely perfect ! my only complaint is my family started cutting away at my beautiful creation before i could take a picture to post . i followed the recipe as is . i did add a little , to o . after i put the brown sugar mix in i sprinkled coconut on top and then layered the pineapple and added some maraschino cherries to the design . i made two cakes and after they cooled i stacked them . simply wonderful - especially the cake 's texture and the way the candied sauce just melts into the cake without making it soggy . someone said they did n't know what stiff but not dry egg whites meant . when you hit that foamy looking stage turn your mixer up and keep going for another minute or so . the egg whites will leave ripples and look shiny .	1
This cake is very moist and has an excellent presentation. I just happened to have fresh pineapple in the house, but no actual juice, so I substituted orange juice, it was wonderful.	this cake is very moist and has an excellent presentation . i just happened to have fresh pineapple in the house , but no actual juice , so i substituted orange juice , it was wonderful .	1

I made this recipe exactly as it said and it was very good! No problems with too runny of a topping as indicated by other reviewers. Pineapple Upside-Down Cake is supposed to be more dense as opposed to light and fluffy and this recipe delivers. The cake remains moist despite the density just make sure you don't overcook it.	i made this recipe exactly as it said and it was very good ! no problems with too runny of a topping as indicated by other reviewers . pineapple upside-down cake is supposed to be more dense as opposed to light and fluffy and this recipe delivers . the cake remains moist despite the density just make sure you do n't overcook it .	1
Had a good flavor, but the cake came out dry. I am not sure what I did, as I followed the recipe precisely. However, maybe I whisked the egg whites too long because it was rather foamy? The cake could use a teaspoon of pineapple extract to up the flavor. 	had a good flavor , but the cake came out dry . i am not sure what i did , as i followed the recipe precisely . however , maybe i whisked the egg whites too long because it was rather foamy ? the cake could use a teaspoon of pineapple extract to up the flavor .	1
Have made this twice now, once with squash, and once with two peeled and chopped yams.  The first time, I accidentally added an extra can of chick peas, and it was so good, I doubled it again the next time! Also added a teaspoon each of cinnamon and cumin.

If you know me at all you know I love to cook. If you don t know me any of my friends will tell you that I m pretty good at it. Last night was no exception if I must say so myself. TagineIt s called Tagine. A Tagine is a portable oven used in moroccan cooking. It s also the name of a dish made from vegetables and meat. I cooked the meat separately this time but I m sure it would be terrific in the pot. It s funny I m not really a big vegetable eater and some of the vegetables in this dish are not very appealing to me but the combination of the vegetables and the spices makes this something special. You have to try it.	if you know me at all you know i love to cook . if you don t know me any of my friends will tell you that i m pretty good at it . last night was no exception if i must say so myself . tagineit s called t agine . a tagine is a portable oven used in moroccan cooking . it s also the name of a dish made from vegetables and meat . i cooked the meat separately this time but i m sure it would be terrific in the pot . it s funny i m not really a big vegetable eater and some of the vegetables in this dish are not very appealing to me but the combination of the vegetables and the spices makes this something spe cial . you have to try it .	1
Despite the fact that I punched this up with a tablespoon of minced ginger root and about a teaspoon of lemon zest (sauted with the chicken onions and garlic) and added 1 tsp of tumeric 1 tsp of cumin and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon with the spices it still tasted rather bland. The chicken didn't pick up any of the flavors and the garbanzo beans seemed to add texture but no flavor. I think next time I'll put the chicken in a ziploc bag with the garlic onion ginger and lemon zest for a few hours before starting. I did like the butternut squash though. It added just enough sweetness.	despite the fact that i punched this up with a tablespoon of minced ginger root and about a teaspoon of lemon zest -lrb- sauted with the chicken onions and garlic -rrb- and added 1 tsp of tumeric 1 tsp of cumin and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon with the spices it still tasted rather bland . the chicken did n't pick up any of the flavors and the garbanzo beans seemed to add texture but no flavor . i think next time i 'll put the chicken in a ziploc bag with the garlic onion ginger and lemon zest for a few hours before starting . i did like the butternut squash though . it added just enough sweetness .	1

I've made this a few times and think it's great! I've tried it both with the butternut squash, and with sweet potatoes (yams) when I had no squash -- either will work fine. Instead of ground coriander (I don't have any) I use fresh coriander -- cilantro. I chop about 1 1/2T and it gives it a pretty look and great flavor. Last time, I also added 1/2t cumin, as well as 1/4 cup raisins. It has a nice sweet/salty flavor -- would be great with fresh lemon wedges as a garnish, as well. To make it more filling, last time I cooked a couple cups of basmati rice and stirred it in at the last minute... not so soupy, but still a nice consistency, and it goes a bit farther.	i 've made this a few times and think it 's great ! i 've tried it both with the butternut squash , and with sweet potatoes -lrb- yams -rrb- when i had no squash -- either will work fine . instead of ground coriander -lrb- i do n't have any -rrb- i use fresh coriander -- cilantro . i chop about 1 1/2 t and it gives it a pretty look and great flavor . last time , i also added 1/2 t cumin , as well as 1/4 cup raisins . it has a nice sweet/salty flavor -- would be great with fresh lemon wedges as a garnish , as well . to make it more filling , last time i cooked a couple cups of basmati rice and stirred it in at the last minute ... n ot so soupy , but still a nice consistency , and it goes a bit farther .	1
This is an incredibly awesome meal!!! If there were more stars I'd rate it higher:) Very easy to do it has a slightly sweet taste from the squash I suppose. I added a dash of cinnamon as they were recommending it in the previous reviews. It s soo good over couscous (I cooked couscou with chicken broth to add more flavour) My husband and children loved it!!

I used a can of mixed beans instead of garbanzo beans. I also added some cauliflower. Extra spices I used were: cumin curry powder tumeric cinnamon. These along with the other spices I added with the onions in the very beginning which gave the chicken more flavour.

Wonderful scone recipe - I froze the butter and then grated it into the dry ingredients. I added a little more sugar, as I love a sweet scone. I used half and half instead of milk and after the egg wash topped them off with turbinado sugar for that extra added crunch. This is a great base for add-ins like dried cranberries and white or dark chocolate chips. These come out of the oven beautiful... almost look too good to eat!	wonderful scone recipe - i froze the butter and then grated it into the dry ingredients . i added a little more sugar , as i love a sweet scone . i used half and half instead of milk and after the egg wa sh topped them off with turbinado sugar for that extra added crunch . this is a great base for add-ins like dried cranberries and white or dark chocolate chips . these come out of the oven beautiful ... almost look too good to eat !	2
"Light, fluffy, and delish. I added dried cherries instead of currants, used splenda instead of sugar, and used almond milk in place of milk, and the recipe turned out great. Super delicious; I could not just have one.  I will definitely save this recipe and use again.

This would be a 5-star recipe if the measurements were accurate. I was hoping for some reader comments but had to figure it out myself. I ended up increasing the amount of flour to about 2 cups and I would have added just a little bit more sugar (not too much since scones shouldn't be overly sweet and it would overpower the natural sweetness of the orange/cranberries I used). With those adjustments though it's a great recipe! Very authentic and delicious! The center is moist but it's got a nice crusty outside. Like other reviewers said it's so versatile! I might try lemon or candied ginger next time.	this would be a 5 star recipe if the measurements were accurate . i was hoping for some reader comments but had to figure it out myself . i ended up increasing the amount of flour to about 2 cups and i would have added just a little bit more sugar -lrb- not too much since scones should n't be overly sweet and it would overpower the natural sweetness of the orange/cranberries i used -rrb- . with those adjustment s though it 's a great recipe ! very authentic and delicious ! the center is moist but it 's got a nice crusty outside . like other reviewers said it 's so versatile ! i might try lemon or candied ginger nex t time .	1

I'm not a fan of red velvet to begin with after reading reviews I thought I would give it a try& I'm not impressed. It's not vanilla and its not chocolate it really has no taste at all.

these cupcakes were good but not exceptional. i made them and tried one. it was good but not as sweet as a cupcake should be. it was still better than box mix though. i gave one to my brother and he said it tasted like regular bread. a tip to anyone making any red velvet recipe: use apple cider vinegar instead of regular vinegar. it adds a bit more flavor to the cupcakes. overall it was okay but just okay. chef john disappointed me. his recipes are usually a lot better.	these cupcakes were good but not exceptional . i made them and tried one . it was good but not as sweet as a cupcake should be . it was still better than box mix though . i gave one to my brother and he s aid it tasted like regular bread . a tip to anyone making any red velvet recipe : use apple cider vinegar instead of regular vinegar . it adds a bit more flavor to the cupcakes . overall it was okay but j ust okay . chef john disappointed me . his recipes are usually a lot better .	1

I made these for Valentine's Day and they were a big hit. Nice and moist. The only change I made was with the food coloring. Since I was using a gel food color I knew that a tablespoon would be too much so added it to the batter a little bit at a time until I got the color I wanted. Would definitely make them again.	i made these for valentine 's day and they were a big hit . nice and moist . the only change i made was with the food coloring . since i was using a gel food color i knew that a tablespoon would be too mu ch so added it to the batter a little bit at a time until i got the color i wanted . would definitely make them again .	1

These are fantastic! I've made several bathces of these in the past few months. Yes the nuts can be difficult to cut through- I coarsley chop mine. I've also coated one side in white chocolate then drizzled it with milk chocolate- beautiful presentation & tastes great! DO use parchment paper as the recipe calls for or they will stick. Wetting your hands does make shaping the sticky dough very easy. These also freeze beautifully. 5 stars!!	these are fantastic ! i 've made several bathces of these in the past few months . yes the nuts can be difficult to cut through - i coarsley chop mine . i 've also coated one side in white chocolate then dr izzled it with milk chocolate - beautiful presentation & tastes great ! do use parchment paper as the recipe calls for or they will stick . wetting your hands does make shaping the sticky dough very easy . these also freeze beautifully . 5 stars !!	1

Have to give this a just OK rating as I'm not real excited about the olive oil flavor that sneaks through. Otherwise this is a good biscotti and I agree with the others who have added that hint of orange; I substituted orange extract for the almond.	have to give this a just ok rating as i 'm not real excited about the olive oil flavor that sneaks through . otherwise this is a good biscotti and i agree with the others who have added that hint of ora nge ; i substituted orange extract for the almond .	1
I grated one whole orange and used all the zest as it tends to have a better kick and presentation.  Also instead of orange juice, I squeeze all the juice of the grated orange.  Use 1/3 of the juice mix into the cookie batter (to give a more citrus-y taste) and the rest for the frosting.	i grated one whole orange and used all the zest as it tends to have a better kick and presentation . also instead of orange juice , i squeeze all the juice of the grated orange . use 1/3 of the juice m ix into the cookie batter -lrb- to give a more citrus-y taste -rrb- and the rest for the frosting .	1
VERY good! Chewy. a bit on the sweet side with the glaze I preferred it without it and I REALLY like my sweets! I'd also suggest adding 1/2 cup of flour which would produce a slightly softer less sweet cookie. But over all the taste is great!

This is my recipe, the temperature is not a mistake in the directions. It is to bake at a slow rate to keep the cake moist. This recipe has been made by tons of friends of mine over and over, not one of them has had a problem with the directions, temperature, or the ingredients.   Check your oven temperature with a thermometer, also use the correct size pan. It all makes a difference!!!  Pyrex pans are freezer to oven...their claim to fame when first on the market...that dates me, I guess. 	this is my recipe , the temperature is not a mistake in the directions . it is to bake at a slow rate to keep the cake moist . this recipe has been made by tons of friends of mine over and over , not one of them has had a problem with the directions , temperature , or the ingredients . check your oven temperature with a thermometer , also use the correct size pan . it all makes a difference !!! pyrex pan s are freezer to oven ... their claim to fame when first on the market ... that dates me , i guess .	1

This cake is delicious. I used 1 1/2 sticks butter, 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1 ¾ cups fresh blueberries. Some reviewers mentioned it flattening out.

This made a very moist heavy coffee cake but oh so delicious! I cut back butter to 1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup) as suggested by others and cut sugar back to 1 cup. Also dusted pecans with flour before adding to cake. Others said they collapsed cake and this old trick from my grandma works fine for that. I did use 2 cups blueberries and a little more cinnamon than suggested.

This simply is the best recipe to impress your friends not for the diet conscious. I like its heavy moist texture preferably the next day served cold for me. I'm spreading the word here in Australia!

What a winner! Noticing the recipe called for no fat, I was tempted to add a 1/2 stick of butter and I'm so glad I didn't and stuck to the recipe as written, only adding 1 tsp. of vanilla to the batter. This was SO nice and moist with a perfect amount of rhubarb.  Any more, I fear, might have made this soggy rather than cakey, particularly after the first day. I was afraid of glopping on the cinnamon by shaking it over the topping, so rather than take a chance I mixed maybe 3/4 tsp. of cinnamon in with the topping ingredients. Good call I think!

Very moist and flavorful cake.  I got great reviews.  However, if the topping was suppose to be a crumb topping like a crumb cake, mine did not turn out that way.  More flour would have been needed. I will be using this recipe again in the near future.  I used frozen rhubarb.	very moist and flavorful cake . i got great reviews . however , if the topping was suppose to be a crumb topping like a crumb cake , mine did not turn out that way . more flour would have been needed . i will be using this recipe again in the near future . i used frozen rhubarb .	1
This cake is amazing! I followed several other suggestions, and used 4 cups of diced rhubarb, and 1/4 cup brown sugar in the cake and all brown sugar in the topping. I had slightly less than a cup of sour cream, so I made up the rest with some vanilla yogurt. The rhubarb taste is very subtle, even with four cups of fruit. This was yummy as a morning coffee cake; yummy with afternoon tea, and especially terrific served warm with a scoop of strawberry ice cream for dessert! Alas, the cake lasted less than a day!	this cake is amazing ! i followed several other suggestions , and used 4 cups of diced rhubarb , and 1/4 cup brown sugar in the cake and all brown sugar in the topping . i had slightly less than a cup of sour cream , so i made up the rest with some vanilla yogurt . the rhubarb taste is very subtle , even with four cups of fruit . this was yummy as a morning coffee cake ; yummy with afternoon tea , and espec ially terrific served warm with a scoop of strawberry ice cream for dessert ! alas , the cake lasted less than a day !	1

Wow...Wow! YUMMY is all I can say about this cake...I actually just got this recipe from a friend and came on here to see if anything like this was already posted - this is the exact same recipe and it is amazing! Not too overwhelming with rhubarb but something different than pie or jam.

I was initially drawn to this recipe because of the minimal fat. I adapted the recipe a bit to try and make it a little healthier: I used 1/2 the amount of sugar (by using Splenda brown sugar) and used whole wheat flour in both the cake and topping. I added 2 tbsp of egg white as I found the cake batter a little dry. And I also used 2 tbsp of apple sauce instead of the oil for the topping. It was REALLY more like a paste, so I had to put it on top by spreading it out by hand. I also baked them in muffin trays as they're a little more portable, but my rhubarb chunks were a little large, so they tended to collapse a bit. I also added the cinnemon as well as ground cloves and allspice into the topping. But VERY moist and delicious cake! Will DEFINATELY make again and look forward to adapting even more!	i was initially drawn to this recipe because of the minimal fat . i adapted the recipe a bit to try and make it a little healthier : i used 1/2 the amount of sugar -lrb- by using splenda brown sugar -rrb- and use d whole wheat flour in both the cake and topping . i added 2 tbsp of egg white as i found the cake batter a little dry . and i also used 2 tbsp of apple sauce instead of the oil for the topping . it was really more like a paste , so i had to put it on top by spreading it out by hand . i also baked them in muffin trays as they 're a little more portable , but my rhubarb chunks were a little large , so they tended to collapse a bit . i also added the cinnemon as well as ground cloves and allspice into the topping . but very moist and delicious cake ! will definately make again and look forward to adapting even more !	1

I made this for my dad's birthday as his favorite desserts are made with rhubarb. I do think it needed more rhubarb than called for. That was also my first impression when I put it in the pan but I didn't want to alter the recipe and possibly have it turn out wrong. The rhubarb really cooked down to a very thin layer of rhubarb. As a whole it didn't have that strong rhubarb flavor I was looking for. The sour cream on top was just fine though I was not sure I wanted to add it I'm glad I did. I'd probably make this again adding more rhubarb.	i made this for my dad 's birthday as his favorite desserts are made with rhubarb . i do think it needed more rhubarb than called for . that was also my first impression when i put it in the pan but i di d n't want to alter the recipe and possibly have it turn out wrong . the rhubarb really cooked down to a very thin layer of rhubarb . as a whole it did n't have that strong rhubarb flavor i was looking fo r . the sour cream on top was just fine though i was not sure i wanted to add it i 'm glad i did . i 'd probably make this again adding more rhubarb .	1
What a great change from the everyday cheesecake. The rhubarb gave this cake a great unique tangy flavour. The crust was wonderfully different... like shortbread.

I love this stuffing! This is the second time I've made this and it turned out awesome. Make sure to use a large stock pot to cook the wild rice in because you end up adding a lot more to the pot later on. For the herbs I used 1 Tbsp. rosemary 2 Tbsp. basil 1 Tbsp. oregano 1 Tbsp. thyme 1/2 Tbsp. marjoram and 1/2 tsp. ground sage. I also added 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper. The great thing is you can adjust the herbs according to your tastes. To cut costs I only used raisins and craisins (skipping the apricots and cherries).

I purchased a long grain and wild rice combination and just cooked it up acocrding to the package directions. I used microwave bacon (I hate bacon grease) and set it aside. I sauteed the onion and celery and added the fruit to the rice while the rice was still a little 'wet'. Added the celery and onion the dry herb mix (basil organo thyme sage) to the rice and fruit and cooked on med-low until everything was cooked through. Added the bacon and parley and mixed until warm. This is an incredible dish. DH and I plan on using this a a foundation form here on out and will play around with substituting the bacon for chicken sauage and the fruits and herbs.	i purchased a long grain and wild rice combination and just cooked it up acocrding to the package directions . i used microwave bacon -lrb- i hate bacon grease -rrb- and set it aside . i sauteed the onion and cel ery and added the fruit to the rice while the rice was still a little ` wet ' . added the celery and onion the dry herb mix -lrb- basil organo thyme sage -rrb- to the rice and fruit and cooked on med-low until eve rything was cooked through . added the bacon and parley and mixed until warm . this is an incredible dish . dh and i plan on using this a a foundation form here on out and will play around with substitut ing the bacon for chicken sauage and the fruits and herbs .	1

The instructions for the recipe are not written correctly omitting the broth that is called for in the ingredients list. The uncooked long grain rice do not soften in the time instructed. I think this would be a great recipe if the long grain were pre-cooked and then mixed into the other ingredients. The flavor was good the texture was crunchy. No one would eat it at Thanksgiving.	the instructions for the recipe are not written correctly omitting the broth that is called for in the ingredients list . the uncooked long grain rice do not soften in the time instructed . i think this would be a great recipe if the long grain were pre-cooked and then mixed into the other ingredients . the flavor was good the texture was crunchy . no one would eat it at thanksgiving .	1
Liked this a bunch. Went great with a roast pork tenderloin. I just made my wild rice separately as well as the white rice. With the wild rice I used chicken broth plus some water. Added some golden raisins as well. This was very tasty served cold as well.	liked this a bunch . went great with a roast pork tenderloin . i just made my wild rice separately as well as the white rice . with the wild rice i used chicken broth plus some water . added some golden r aisins as well . this was very tasty served cold as well .	1
"Since writing this recipe I have changed to a skillet.  Brown chicken breasts on both sides in olive oil.  Squeeze 1/2 of a lemon over all.  Cover with lid over medium heat.  Cook til done.
Turning a few more times.  If you want it more lemony add a teaspoon of lemon zest.

Made this last night. It was simple enough but I highly recommend doubling the sauce for your recipe. In my case rather than using 6 breasts for the 4 serving size I used 3 breasts and left the sauce amount as is. There was barely enough for my reduced serving. Anyway the chicken came out beautifully. As other reviewers mentioned it could have used more flavor. I'll make sure to salt and pepper the breasts in the future. In addition the sauce could have used more flavor. I used half broth and half wine for my version. I also added garlic powder but it needed something more. Perhaps a bit of rosemary?? All in all I enjoyed the textures of everything just need to spice it up a bit in the future. My accompaniments were brown rice and asparagus.	made this last night . it was simple enough but i highly recommend doubling the sauce for your recipe . in my case rather than using 6 breasts for the 4 serving size i used 3 breasts and left the sauce amount as is . there was barely enough for my reduced serving . anyway the chicken came out beautifully . as other reviewers mentioned it could have used more flavor . i 'll make sure to salt and pepper th e breasts in the future . in addition the sauce could have used more flavor . i used half broth and half wine for my version . i also added garlic powder but it needed something more . perhaps a bit of ro semary ?? all in all i enjoyed the textures of everything just need to spice it up a bit in the future . my accompaniments were brown rice and asparagus .	1
This was very good. I took the suggestion and instead of putting it in the oven I just cooked it in a skillet. Also didn't have lemons so I just used lemon juice and also sprinkled Lemon Pepper seasoning. I used a whole can of Chicken Broth so I could have more gravy. Turned out great-- my whole family enjoyed this recipe.

EXCELLENT!! I am going to recommend this recipe to people. I put some asparagus in with the chicken while it baked and it soaked up the lemon flavor and tasted really good! I added some white wine with a cube of chicken boulion instead of chicken broth. It came out great and it was quite simple and is pretty fool proof.

I marinated the chicken in lemon juice and olive oil for about an hour before cooking in the skillet as suggested by other reviewers. It turned out wonderful. I also added 1 whole cup of chicken broth which yielded a nice amount of sauce for the chicken.

I made as listed but probably should have trusted my instinct to tweak a bit. We all thought this was missing something. The chicken did turn out nice and moist with a pleasant lemon taste but if I were to make this again I'd definitely add minced garlic and perhaps marinate the chicken ahead of time so that it picks up a bit more flavor.	i made as listed but probably should have trusted my instinct to tweak a bit . we all thought this was missing something . the chicken did turn out nice and moist with a pleasant lemon taste but if i we re to make this again i 'd definitely add minced garlic and perhaps marinate the chicken ahead of time so that it picks up a bit more flavor .	1

Absolutely delicious! I did something a little different. I put 3 chicken breasts at a time in a 1 gallon freezer bag and pounded the breasts so they were more even in thickness. I also dipped the breasts in butter and then breaded it. I used seasoned cornbread stuffing and of course more curry and parmesean. (because we love curry and parmesean) Then I placed the chicken in a dish sprayed with PAM and turned 1/2 way through cooking. It browned up nicely and the breading stayed on. It was a hit! Plus I made it ahead of time and just had to take it out of the fridge and put in the ove. LOVED IT.

Awesome! I'm a huge fan of the Applebee's version and this is just as satisfying. For the dressing (which I did not double--was enough for me) I also added about a tablespoon of taco seasoning to kick it up a bit. I also burned the crispies so I just crumbled up a few tortilla chips for topping. Like Applebee's I also served it with a dallop of sour cream a dallop of salsa and a dallop of homemade guacamole.

Excellent and very flavorful. Only gave it four stars because I modified the recipe. I substituted the Tarragon vinegar w/ white wine vinegar and the safflower oil w/ EVOO as both were hard to find in the store. I also used half the amount of crushed red pepper.

This was good! I used Uncle Ben s Long and Wild Rice and seasoned the chicken well with Montreal Seasoning before sautéing.

Good stuff! I made this for a family party... that I later had to skip... so I was left with a double recipe's worth. I am eating it this week for lunch at the office.

This was great. I didn't understand a couple of the reviews that said it was dry. This is very creamy. I had some brown rice left over from another recipe so I had to scale the recipe back to match the amount of rice I had.

Not nearly as much flavor as I thought it would have. Still good just different than I expected.	not nearly as much flavor as i thought it would have . still good just different than i expected .	1
I Thought this recipe was great! My family does not eat pork so I switched the bacon for a can of chickpeas and it was fantastic! You could also swap the sour cream for 'soy cream' substitute and make the dish vegan friendly! we also tried it with wild rice mixed in and it added an extra nutty crunch! we will surely make it again! thank you!	i thought this recipe was great ! my family does not eat pork so i switched the bacon for a can of chickpeas and it was fantastic ! you could also swap the sour cream for ` soy cream ' substitute and make the dish vegan friendly ! we also tried it with wild rice mixed in and it added an extra nutty crunch ! we will surely make it again ! thank you !	1
I really liked the flavors of this creamy and satisfying salad. I left out the cilantro cause I really dont care for it and it was great. A great way to get in your fiber. I used minute brown rice also cause its easier. Wonderful!

A delicious recipe! I doubled the spices and left out the cilantro as my family doesn't care for it. And as another cook suggested I also omitted the bacon & added chick peas.

Yum. Few minor changes due to what was in the kitchen: fat free sour cream instead of low fat canadian bacon instead of traditional and pine nuts in stead of almonds. I also used red pepper flakes instead of a res bell pepper. I had some leftover english cucumber from another salad recipe so I tiossed that in as well. Would be good with some tomatoes in this as well. as well as some broccoli slaw	yum . few minor changes due to what was in the kitchen : fat free sour cream instead of low fat canadian bacon instead of traditional and pine nuts in stead of almonds . i also used red pepper flakes ins tead of a res bell pepper . i had some leftover english cucumber from another salad recipe so i tiossed that in as well . would be good with some tomatoes in this as well . as well as some broccoli slaw	1
I have made this salad about 10 times now for various people and they all love it - even my picky teenagers! The only change I make is to use dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard because I think it tastes much better. Also as someone else said here only half the recommended dressing is needed. This salad has become a staple of our diet.	i have made this salad about 10 times now for various people and they all love it - even my picky teenagers ! the only change i make is to use dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard because i think it tastes much better . also as someone else said here only half the recommended dressing is needed . this salad has become a staple of our diet .	1
This is a great simple salad! Omitted the avocado (didn't have one) but added about 1/4 shredded aged white cheddar. Tossed with half the dressing and that was plenty. Will definitely make this again.	this is a great simple salad ! omitted the avocado -lrb- did n't have one -rrb- but added about 1/4 shredded aged white cheddar . tossed with half the dressing and that was plenty . will definitely make this again .	1
Would make kale slices even smaller and marinate in the lemon for at least an hour beforehand so the citrus can break down the kale better. Cut the dressing in half and still had leftover the 1/2 cup of oil just didn't seem right for 6 cups of greens. Also only used one large apple and cut into smaller bite sized pieces but threw in the whole avocado - as everyone knows they don't keep well once cut open. Substituted smoked salmon for the bacon which was great and used Dijon mustard loved dressing the flavor.	would make kale slices even smaller and marinate in the lemon for at least an hour beforehand so the citrus can break down the kale better . cut the dressing in half and still had leftover the 1/2 cup of oil just did n't seem right for 6 cups of greens . also only used one large apple and cut into smaller bite sized pieces but threw in the whole avocado - as everyone knows they do n't keep well once c ut open . substituted smoked salmon for the bacon which was great and used dijon mustard loved dressing the flavor .	1
We have gobs of kale in our garden and this is my absolute favorite go-to salad. I can eat it all summer long and never grow tired of it.

Absolute best salad ever just as it is. However I often don't have avocado's so I omit them sometimes and have often times used Swiss Chard instead of Kale. I think it is mainly the dressing and you could add whatever else you wanted for the salad part except of course you would have to keep the lovely smoked bacon in it. I also agree with others on probably not using all the salad dressing. I just mix up a double batch and use what I want and keep it in the frig for the next time. Set it out a little before supper so the olive oil melts and it is ready to go.	absolute best salad ever just as it is . however i often do n't have avocado 's so i omit them sometimes and have often times used swiss chard instead of kale . i think it is mainly the dressing and you c ould add whatever else you wanted for the salad part except of course you would have to keep the lovely smoked bacon in it . i also agree with others on probably not using all the salad dressing . i jus t mix up a double batch and use what i want and keep it in the frig for the next time . set it out a little before supper so the olive oil melts and it is ready to go .	1
Did not use the maple syrup because I did not have any. I used brown sugar instead. But it was a hit nonetheless!

This was yummy! I find raw kale to be a bit coarse so I used finely shredded baby kale and tossed it with the dressing about an hour before adding the rest of the ingredients.	this was yummy ! i find raw kale to be a bit coarse so i used finely shredded baby kale and tossed it with the dressing about an hour before adding the rest of the ingredients .	1
I know this is definitely healthy but I need something to soften the stiffness (lack of a better word) of the kale. Most kale salads that appeal to me are drizzled with a hot oil to wilt the kale slightly and then sprinkled with a light dusting of finely shredded cheese.	i know this is definitely healthy but i need something to soften the stiffness -lrb- lack of a better word -rrb- of the kale . most kale salads that appeal to me are drizzled with a hot oil to wilt the kale slig htly and then sprinkled with a light dusting of finely shredded cheese .	1
Great recipe! I had two people from India helping me make it and they suggested these changes: more curry (they added about 8 tbls), fresh ground pepper, and use Indian Chili powder not cayenne and increase the amount to about 3 tsp. They said that cayenne is a western spice and Indian chili powder is more authentic. This made it VERY hot. We used the sauce to help spice up another mild curry dish we had.	great recipe ! i had two people from india helping me make it and they suggested these changes : more curry -lrb- they added about 8 tbls -rrb- , fresh ground pepper , and use indian chili powder not cayenne and in crease the amount to about 3 tsp . they said that cayenne is a western spice and indian chili powder is more authentic . this made it very hot . we used the sauce to help spice up another mild curry dish we had .	2
"I used this recipe when I made curry myself for the first time ever. I loved it! Absolutely wonderful. 

Having experimented with the recipe since that first experience, I suggest trying out a different first step. 

In a dry pot pre-heated to a medium heat, first roast the curry powder for a minute or until browned, stirring constantly. Add the paprika and the cinnamon, and ginger stirring constantly. (I do not add the sugar) Then add the garlic, bay leaf, and onions, and drizzle the olive oil over top. You can do this with about 1 1/2- 2tbsp. of olive oil. Continue as per the recipe. 

I found that that extra first step enriches the flavor of the curry powder and makes for a fuller-bodied/ slightly spicier curry.

A very nice Chicken Curry.  I also used 1 tsp. of Garam Masala.  I wish I had left out the lemon and the cayenne because I thought it tasted better before those were added.  I even cut down the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. because my youngest daughter doesn't like it too hot.  I think that next time I will omit the last two ingredients.  	a very nice chicken curry . i also used 1 tsp . of garam masala . i wish i had left out the lemon and the cayenne because i thought it tasted better before those were added . i even cut down the cayenn e to 1/4 tsp . because my youngest daughter does n't like it too hot . i think that next time i will omit the last two ingredients .	1
My first comment is to read through the rest of the reviews before making this dish. The recipe alone is a great starting place but you may want to take some of the suggestions you read to make it just right for you. Not everyone likes the same flavors so you need to tweak it specifically for your taste buds.

Ok I did this a lot differently. First of all you should probably add more pasta if you don't want too much of the sauce. I omitted the mustard. I added 1 cup colby and 1/1/2 cup mozzarella and then salt pepper and italian seasonings. Oh ya and peas. Was a great dish will definately make again. This is a good recipe to keep around just for the fact that you can do so much with it(use it as a base). Maybe add chicken or turkey and/or french cut green beans next time. Maybe top it off with some sliced cherry tomatoes.	ok i did this a lot differently . first of all you should probably add more pasta if you do n't want too much of the sauce . i omitted the mustard . i added 1 cup colby and 1/1/2 cup mozzarella and then s alt pepper and italian seasonings . oh ya and peas . was a great dish will definately make again . this is a good recipe to keep around just for the fact that you can do so much with it -lrb- use it as a base -rrb- . maybe add chicken or turkey and/or french cut green beans next time . maybe top it off with some sliced cherry tomatoes .	1
We had a big ham for Christmas with lots of leftovers to use up. This recipe had all the ingredients that my family loves ham cheese noodles garlic I mean what s not to like? And the added bonus was that I had all the ingredients on hand. Which meant no trip needed to the grocery store! Gotta love that! I followed the recipe exactly as stated and it turned out really yummy! Cheesy gooey and warm on a cold stormy winter night! Served with a big green salad. Will serve with some rolls next time too. My husband s only complaint was that it was a tad salty. So the next time I make this I won t add salt to the pasta water when I cook the noodles and I won t be adding any salt to the recipe. The Parmesan cheese and ham provide more than enough salt for this dish. One added bonus about this recipe is that while the noodles are cooking you can make up the sauce and slice the ham; then while the dish is baking in the oven you have just enough time to clean up the dirty pan from the sauce tidy up the kitchen set the table and toss the salad; then after dinner there s only the casserole dish the dinner plates and utensils to wash up! Nice! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

"I made this and several other pumpkin pie recipes for Thanksgiving this one was declared the favorite. My original feeling about it was that it was a little too sweet but I was voted down. I might cut the white sugar by half next time though. I would also make sure you either have an extra crust or some oven-proof bowls it was way too much filling for even my 9"" deep dish crust. Used this recipe again this year and followed it exactly. Either I didn't do it right last year or my tastes have changed it's delicious! It still makes enough for two pies from each batch but everyone loved them so they disappeared VERY quickly!"	i made this and several other pumpkin pie recipes for thanksgiving this one was declared the favorite . my original feeling about it was that it was a little too sweet but i was voted down . i might cut the white sugar by half next time though . i would also make sure you either have an extra crust or some oven-proof bowls it was way too much filling for even my 9 '' deep dish crust . used this recipe a gain this year and followed it exactly . either i did n't do it right last year or my tastes have changed it 's delicious ! it still makes enough for two pies from each batch but everyone loved them so th ey disappeared very quickly !	1
This pie was amazing. I've been making pies from a can since I was a kid and I had a pumpkin leftover from Halloween and had guests coming over for dinner so I thought what the heck and made the pumpkin puree myself. One thing to keep in mind is that it the filling made with homemade pureed pumpkin is much more watery than a canned pumpkin pie so don't be surprised when you put it into the pie crust. I accidentally spilled a good portion of it out of the shell but that ended up being a good thing since it took awhile to cook. I would suggest making a thinner pie rather than deep-dish with this recipe so that the crust won't burn by the time the filling sets up (took about an hour with filling that was maybe 1 1/2 inches thick) and the filling will rise a bit so it won't be thin in the end. I did have maybe 1/3 of the filling leftover after I filled my crust so I threw it in a loaf pan and baked it separately to make a pumpkin custard. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and drained the puree in a colander lined with coffee filters overnight which yielded at least a cup of water which would have made the pie soggy so I'm glad I did that and would suggest it to another who wants to make this pie from scratch. The end result was the absolute best pumpkin pie that I've ever had. Wasn't difficult but was time-consuming but definitely worth the effort.	this pie was amazing . i 've been making pies from a can since i was a kid and i had a pumpkin leftover from halloween and had guests coming over for dinner so i thought what the heck and made the pumpk in puree myself . one thing to keep in mind is that it the filling made with homemade pureed pumpkin is much more watery than a canned pumpkin pie so do n't be surprised when you put it into the pie cru st. i accidentally spilled a good portion of it out of the shell but that ended up being a good thing since it took awhile to cook . i would suggest making a thinner pie rather than deep-dish with this recipe so that the crust wo n't burn by the time the filling sets up -lrb- took about an hour with filling that was maybe 1 1/2 inches thick -rrb- and the filling will rise a bit so it wo n't be thin in the end . i did have maybe 1/3 of the filling leftover after i filled my crust so i threw it in a loaf pan and baked it separately to make a pumpkin custard . i followed the suggestion of another reviewer and d rained the puree in a colander lined with coffee filters overnight which yielded at least a cup of water which would have made the pie soggy so i 'm glad i did that and would suggest it to another who wants to make this pie from scratch . the end result was the absolute best pumpkin pie that i 've ever had . was n't difficult but was time-consuming but definitely worth the effort .	1
With all the positive reviews I was disappointed with the end product. Used homemade pumpkin puree. Sorry to say it was a waste of time. The pie was edible but NOT as a pumpkin pie. Very little pumpkin taste and too many spices. Filling is very runny (even after I used less liquid.....) however it did thicken up nicely. I have to mention the color: not very inviting. I won't be using this recipe again.	with all the positive reviews i was disappointed with the end product . used homemade pumpkin puree . sorry to say it was a waste of time . the pie was edible but not as a pumpkin pie . very little pumpki n taste and too many spices . filling is very runny -lrb- even after i used less liquid ... -rrb- however it did thicken up nicely . i have to mention the color : not very inviting . i wo n't be using this recipe a gain .	1
So good. I'm obsessed with broccoli and this was perfect -- I could eat it three meals a day. I cut back the ham and cheese to 1c. each per reviews and it seemed to be a good quantity to prevent overfilling. Added a sprinkle of nutmeg to the egg mix and stirred the paprika in instead of sprinkling on top. I put some of the cheese on the bottom some mixed in and some on top.	so good . i 'm obsessed with broccoli and this was perfect -- i could eat it three meals a day . i cut back the ham and cheese to 1 c. each per reviews and it seemed to be a good quantity to prevent overf illing . added a sprinkle of nutmeg to the egg mix and stirred the paprika in instead of sprinkling on top . i put some of the cheese on the bottom some mixed in and some on top .	1

Couldn't find spinach at the last minute so I substituted mixed spinach and lettuce. Didn't seem to make any difference people LOVED it. It was excellent and I followed the original recipe for the dressing. I really don't like yellow mustard but decided to go ahead with it because of the tang. So glad I did it wasn't too mustardy at all. The only thing I changed was cooking the onions in with the bacon.

Made as written with one exception and that is that I only used 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/3 cup. I only made the change due to personal preference. From past experience I've learned that we like equal ratio of sugar and vinegar. This was excellent! If you are like us and there is only two of you keep your dressing separate an add it to your individual servings to keep the spinach from wilting.

This recipe is a great concept but it always bothers me when any recipe calls for 1 1/2 cups of chopped chicken--it ought to say how much that weighs--that would keep the reproducing of the recipe consistent. Also 6 tablespoons of onions? What am i supposed to do--chop the onions and take a tablespoon measure and measure the onions out 6 times? And raw almonds or any nuts don't ever add much to a dish for me--toast them? and it's all the difference in the world. I compliment the person who put this together because it's a really nice combination of flavors. I added a chopped boiled egg--and used Vidalia onions for a sweeter and not overpowering onion taste.	this recipe is a great concept but it always bothers me when any recipe calls for 1 1/2 cups of chopped chicken -- it ought to say how much that weighs -- that would keep the reproducing of the recipe con sistent . also 6 tablespoons of onions ? what am i supposed to do -- chop the onions and take a tablespoon measure and measure the onions out 6 times ? and raw almonds or any nuts do n't ever add much to a dish for me -- toast them ? and it 's all the difference in the world . i compliment the person who put this together because it 's a really nice combination of flavors . i added a chopped boiled egg -- and us ed vidalia onions for a sweeter and not overpowering onion taste .	1
some time. If I'm out of dried cranberries cut in half grapes work well. Like another mentioned I add red onion and cracked pepper to the mix. I'm a fan of cucumber so it's not uncommon for me to add in a diced handful. Radishes are also an excellent addition. Served over a bed of lettuce without the pasta as a sandwich ( I love this stuffed into a pita) or mounded on crackers ( Triscuit is a fantastic choice for this) this always hits the spot on a hot summer day when ease a light fare and coolness are just whats needed.

Can't find a thing wrong with this recipe. I had some cooked chicken in the fridge and everything else in the pantry. You might want to add some salt and pepper but I don't think it needs anything.	ca n't find a thing wrong with this recipe . i had some cooked chicken in the fridge and everything else in the pantry . you might want to add some salt and pepper but i do n't think it needs anything .	1

I made this recipe with a bit of a twist using bowtie pasta and bottled poppy seed dressing. I also deleted the cucumbers because I do not care for them in salads. The onion and green pepper provided just enough flavor with the creamy poppy seed dressing. It was fantastic and my husband loved it!

I give this recipe high marks for its simplicity and flavor. The ingredients are ones I'm likely to have on-hand in the pantry or deep-freeze. It is good as a side in a buffet-style luncheon or handy to-go lunch in a pita pocket. It is a nice break from tuna or chicken salad. I will make this again.	i give this recipe high marks for its simplicity and flavor . the ingredients are ones i 'm likely to have on-hand in the pantry or deep-freeze . it is good as a side in a buffet-style luncheon or handy to-go lunch in a pita pocket . it is a nice break from tuna or chicken salad . i will make this again .	1

This is one of three recipes I made to use up the holiday ham. It's a great quick side dish. I omitted the onions but added celery. I also did a mix of Mayo and sour cream.

This is a super easy to throw together salad. Per personal preference I'll probably cut the mayo w/sour cream if I make this again because I'm not a big fan of mayo. Mr. LTH enjoyed this and so did I but I'm not quite sure what it is? Is it a sandwich spread? Is it a side? I appreciate the versatility but I'm not sure what I'd make this as.

I think it was the same time last year that I last tried this recipe because I love green peas and had ham left over from Christmas dinner and I just really loved how this salad turned out! I especially love that it's all ingredients I usually have on hand anyway:-) I think last time I made it I added a little bit if diced celery too to add an little extra crunch!	i think it was the same time last year that i last tried this recipe because i love green peas and had ham left over from christmas dinner and i just really loved how this salad turned out ! i especial ly love that it 's all ingredients i usually have on hand anyway :--rrb- i think last time i made it i added a little bit if diced celery too to add an little extra crunch !	1

This is such a fantastic recipe! I often bulk it out a bit by using more onion a couple of different colored peppers etc; adding a can of pinto beans doesn't hurt either. More often that not I make it more as a stew - dice up the chicken into bite-sized pieces brown them in olive oil then throw in the rest of the ingredients (except the avocado of course) and let it do its thing. Great with regular white rice and the leftovers are superb in warm flour tortillas.

So easy and so delicious! I would say the only changes I made were to use fresh garlic instead of the Goya minced and I didn't need the sliced pimientos for garnish. It was great without it. And I used boneless skinless chicken thighs which was what I had on hand. Next time I'll try cutting the oil down to 2 tbsp. to cut down on fat a little. But the whole family loved this and my kids can be pretty picky eaters.

The fisrt time I made this it was salty and the rice was mushy. The Adobo chicken buillon sazon seasoning packet pimentos and alcaparrados ALL contain salt. When I seasoned the chicken I treated the adobo like it was salt (sprinkle VERY lightly). Also I used a small red bell pepperbin place of the pimentos and rinsed off some capers in place of the alcapparado. You can put the frozen peas in the rice before you pour the water in. I also increased the rice to 2 cups and used about 3&3/4) cups of water. It was so easy and came out great.	the fisrt time i made this it was salty and the rice was mushy . the adobo chicken buillon sazon seasoning packet pimentos and alcaparrados all contain salt . when i seasoned the chicken i treated the a dobo like it was salt -lrb- sprinkle very lightly -rrb- . also i used a small red bell pepperbin place of the pimentos and rinsed off some capers in place of the alcapparado . you can put the frozen peas in the r ice before you pour the water in . i also increased the rice to 2 cups and used about 3 & 3/4 -rrb- cups of water . it was so easy and came out great .	1
Absolutely Delicious!!! Extremely easy to make and cooks fairly quickly. Cheap meal that feeds alot of people and tastes great! Would def reccommend to others. Very authentic tasting. My only thing to point out is the chicken doesnt shred of the bone so at the end take a fork and pull apart chicken from the bones and mix in. That is if you prefer it that way.	absolutely delicious !!! extremely easy to make and cooks fairly quickly . cheap meal that feeds alot of people and tastes great ! would def reccommend to others . very authentic tasting . my only thing to point out is the chicken doesnt shred of the bone so at the end take a fork and pull apart chicken from the bones and mix in . that is if you prefer it that way .	1
I very much plan on using this recipe A LOT from now on. I have always had a hard time figuring out how to make this dish this way but couldn't so would end up going to bodegas. Heh. I used chicken thighs less alcaparrado (only a few pieces from it) added some red pepper too. I didn't use all Goya products but it still all came out amazing. I added the peas in when the meal was still cooking.

The overall flavor of this was quite good. i didn't have enough bacon drippings and was glad i didn't. i used the 2 tablesp in the dressing(all i really had left over) and did not add any additional oil to make up for it. i cooked the mushrooms in olive oil. next time i will lessen the amount of olive oil as well in the dressing as it was much to oily for my taste and some of the sweetness from the balsamic was lost. Also added thin slices red pepper sautéed with the mushroom for additional color and texture. i served it with grilled salmon for protein.	the overall flavor of this was quite good . i did n't have enough bacon drippings and was glad i did n't . i used the 2 tablesp in the dressing -lrb- all i really had left over -rrb- and did not add any additional o il to make up for it . i cooked the mushrooms in olive oil . next time i will lessen the amount of olive oil as well in the dressing as it was much to oily for my taste and some of the sweetness from th e balsamic was lost . also added thin slices red pepper sautéed with the mushroom for additional color and texture . i served it with grilled salmon for protein .	1

I'm always happy to be the first reviewer of a new recipe and report that I enjoyed it and recommend it. This is not a unique pasta salad but it's a good one and the submitter is correct - the bacon and cheddar DOES make it better. In this case I needed something at the last minute and this was good filling and simple. I find that often it's the basic recipes the non-fussy non-fancy recipes that are the best. I stuck pretty much to the submitter's intent only adding a little sour cream as I always do to mayonnaise-based salads to mellow out the tang of the mayo and some thawed frozen peas. This was exactly what I had in mind for our impromptu grilled burgers dinner tonight.	i 'm always happy to be the first reviewer of a new recipe and report that i enjoyed it and recommend it . this is not a unique pasta salad but it 's a good one and the submitter is correct - the bacon a nd cheddar does make it better . in this case i needed something at the last minute and this was good filling and simple . i find that often it 's the basic recipes the non-fussy non-fancy recipes that a re the best . i stuck pretty much to the submitter 's intent only adding a little sour cream as i always do to mayonnaise-based salads to mellow out the tang of the mayo and some thawed frozen peas . thi s was exactly what i had in mind for our impromptu grilled burgers dinner tonight .	1

This salad was ok but I had to adjust the recipe. Using a full pound of macaroni I had to almost double the ranch dressing. I used shredded cheese because that's what I had on hand I think I liked it better than I would have liked cubed. I also wish I had used miracle whip instead of mayo because it needed a little zing (I guess I could have added a little vinegar but didn't think about it at the time). Good starter recipe and easily adjustable to your tastes.	this salad was ok but i had to adjust the recipe . using a full pound of macaroni i had to almost double the ranch dressing . i used shredded cheese because that 's what i had on hand i think i liked it better than i would have liked cubed . i also wish i had used miracle whip instead of mayo because it needed a little zing -lrb- i guess i could have added a little vinegar but did n't think about it at the time -rrb- . good starter recipe and easily adjustable to your tastes .	1

I haven't met too many quiches I didn't like but I thought this was a little better than most, I think, due to the sour cream.  My husband had to ask if there were eggs in it.  I could not find wild rice so ended up using another whole grain, dark colored rice called Forbidden Rice. I'm really not sure the rice added anything to the dish so you could easily substitute a chopped vegetable.	i have n't met too many quiches i did n't like but i thought this was a little better than most , i think , due to the sour cream . my husband had to ask if there were eggs in it . i could not find wild r ice so ended up using another whole grain , dark colored rice called forbidden rice . i 'm really not sure the rice added anything to the dish so you could easily substitute a chopped vegetable .	1

I too am in VA where brunswick stew becomes a household staple during hunting season. Scratch the ground meats use pulled pork roast or steak. Add a pkg. of frozen lima beans. Also switch to niblet corn (1 can) 2 cans cream corn. A little old bay definitely helps as well. This is a lot less expensive and much better tasting than the 10 pint we get from the Ruritan Clubs.

Absolutely the BEST stew I've ever had! I was a little sceptical when reading the ingredients and noticed there were no potatos but WOW!

As a girl who grew up in Georgia and has lately been living in Colorado it's so great to have a recipe for this as you won't find it anywhere outside the South and the only way I can get it is to make it myself! This recipe turned out great just like it should have tasted! The only modification I made was to use only one can of the creamed corn (not being a huge fan of canned cream corn) and added additional frozen corn kernals. Also a couple notes-Hot Sauce (like Tobasco) is essential not so much to make it spicy but to really give it the flavor that makes it brunswick stew. Also many southerners would never add vegetables (potatoes green beans oh the sacrilige!!). So if you want a true brunswick stew stick to the basics (onion etc.) in the recipe. Also instead of the ground pork it is also good with shredded pork roast. This is especially great when eaten with BBQ on a fall Saturday afternoon watching a football game!

The barbeque flavor in this stew is just right.	i do n't know if this will get anyone a husband but the one i have loved it . i am somewhat embarrassed to say that we had leftovers for breakfast this morning ! the barbeque flavor in this stew is just right .	1
This was great! The barbecue sauce gave it a unique flavor (at least for this northern girl). I used shredded beef and pork instead of the ground meat and added about 1/4 cup of Jack Daniels. Delicious.	this was great ! the barbecue sauce gave it a unique flavor -lrb- at least for this northern girl -rrb- . i used shredded beef and pork instead of the ground meat and added about 1/4 cup of jack daniels . deliciou s.	1
None of my family members liked it. I really disliked the sweet taste of the soup. Second of all besides having a bad taste it was very bland ingredients wise. I definitely wouldn't make this again as a soup - however I think it has potential as a dip. If I decreased the liquid added more salt and changed a few things here and there I think this would be a decent dip.	none of my family members liked it . i really disliked the sweet taste of the soup . second of all besides having a bad taste it was very bland ingredients wise . i definitely would n't make this again as a soup - however i think it has potential as a dip . if i decreased the liquid added more salt and changed a few things here and there i think this would be a decent dip .	1
"I've made this twice and I have to tell you the second time I cheated.  I browned the roast then put it in the crock pot and dumped the minced garlic, you know the stuff in a jar and the rosemary on top of the roast and then cut holes in it a kinda pushed the stuff inside and left some on top too.  I didn't make a paste.  Then I drizled a little olive oil on tbe top added salt, pepper and accent.  Threw some dehydrated minced onions on top.  Added the wine and cooked it in the crock pot for 8 hrs.  It came out just as good if not better then the first time.  
This is the absolute best pork roast.

I'm not even sure if I used a loin.  I used that big giant pork roast and cut it and made 3 roasts out of it.  Not the small loin cut."	i 've made this twice and i have to tell you the second time i cheated . i browned the roast then put it in the crock pot and dumped the minced garlic , you know the stuff in a jar and the rosemary on t op of the roast and then cut holes in it a kinda pushed the stuff inside and left some on top too . i did n't make a paste . then i drizled a little olive oil on tbe top added salt , pepper and accent . threw some dehydrated minced onions on top . added the wine and cooked it in the crock pot for 8 hrs . it came out just as good if not better then the first time . this is the absolute best pork roa st. i 'm not even sure if i used a loin . i used that big giant pork roast and cut it and made 3 roasts out of it . not the small loin cut .	1
I thought that this was okay... The rosemary provided some flavor but I didn't feel that there was enough flavor to want to go back for seconds.	i thought that this was okay ... the rosemary provided some flavor but i did n't feel that there was enough flavor to want to go back for seconds .	1
These are the best wings I ever made my family went crazy over them! I didn't even try the sauce mixture we used our favorite bbq sauce for half of them and I made a garlic butter sauce for the other half. I will try the hot sauce recipe next time I make these. The breading is terrific you have to try this recipe!	these are the best wings i ever made my family went crazy over them ! i did n't even try the sauce mixture we used our favorite bbq sauce for half of them and i made a garlic butter sauce for the other half . i will try the hot sauce recipe next time i make these . the breading is terrific you have to try this recipe !	1
