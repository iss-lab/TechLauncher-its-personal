Tastes like a brownie. They are hard to get out of the cupcake tins without them falling. They fall apart easily. Everyone liked them but said they tasted like an uncooked brownie. Soufflés ate soft in the middle so they thought they were undercooked. Follow the directions fully and they come out great. Just that you can’t get them out of the pans without them falling down and apart. I pieced them together and presented them on a plate that was swiped with chocolate sauce and dashed with cinnamon. Garnished with a blueberry and a raspberry. Great presentation but the soufflé looked like a falling apart muffin slash brownie cupcake. If you have a soufflé pan, use that and cook accordingly. The muffin method just is horrible.	tastes like a brownie . they are hard to get out of the cupcake tins without them falling . they fall apart easily . everyone liked them but said they tasted like an uncooked brownie . soufflés ate soft in the middle so they thought they were undercooked . follow the directions fully and they come out great . just that you ca n't get them out of the pans without them falling down and apart . i pieced them together and presented them on a plate that was swiped with chocolate sauce and dashed with cinnamon . garnished with a blueberry and a raspberry . great presentation but the soufflé looked like a falling apart muffin slash brownie cupcake . if you have a soufflé pan , use that and cook accordingly . the muffin method just is horrible .	1
I'm addicted to chocolate (the cravings get especially bad around exam time) and these are my absolute favorite to make when those cravings hit. I know there aren't a lot of review on here now but I encourage everyone to try it!!	i 'm addicted to chocolate -lrb- the cravings get especially bad around exam time -rrb- and these are my absolute favorite to make when those cravings hit . i know there are n't a lot of review on here now but i encourage everyone to try it !!	1

Dark, rich, and creamy souffle-like recipe. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream. This is a modified brownie recipe, reducing the flour and egg amounts, creaming the sugar, and adding heavy cream to create a cross between a chocolate souffle and a brownie.	dark , rich , and creamy souffle-like recipe . serve warm with vanilla ice cream . this is a modified brownie recipe , reducing the flour and egg amounts , creaming the sugar , and adding heavy cream to create a cross between a chocolate souffle and a brownie .	1
This is my favorite favorite chocolate dessert! Since you are only using very few ingredients, make sure they are of the best possible quality - it makes a difference, especially the chocolate you use. Serve with whipped cream for extra decadence.	this is my favorite favorite chocolate dessert ! since you are only using very few ingredients , make sure they are of the best possible quality - it makes a difference , especially the chocolate you use . serve with whipped cream for extra decadence .	1
