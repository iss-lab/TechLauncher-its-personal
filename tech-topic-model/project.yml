title: "Tech Topic Model"
description: "A machine learning model that checks if a news article title is part of the tech topic or not. Based on the demo textcat project
              for spaCy. The data comes from a [Kaggle News Article Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-category-dataset)"
