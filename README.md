# Personal Virtual Assistant for News Filtering
This project aims to use machine learning and natural language processing to create a personal assistant that can filter news based on the user's personal preference.

This is a project done by students from ANU (Australian National University) as part of their [TechLauncher](https://cs.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/) program
